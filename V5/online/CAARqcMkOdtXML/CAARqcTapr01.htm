<h2><a name="Why"></a>About Automatic Testing</h2>
<p>Automatic testing is strongly dedicated to unit and possibly integration test 
levels, and can be also used for non regression, performance, and robustness test 
types to name but a few.</p>
<p>Like for development tasks, tests activities can take place in your environment 
that provides an infrastructure for writing, delivering, and running test programs 
associated with your application frameworks.</p>
<p>The mkodt command of Native Apps Unit Tester runs your test programs from within 
this infrastructure.</p>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h2><a name="Using"></a>Using the Development Tools Test Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The Development Tools supplies an infrastructure to test your frameworks and 
applications. This infrastructure is fully integrated in the development environment 
you use to develop your frameworks and applications and takes advantage of the same 
tools and mechanisms. In addition, it allows you to automate the test program execution.</p>

<h3><a name="Frameworks"></a>Tests Are Related to Frameworks</h3>
<p>Test programs are written for a specific purpose (i.e. test a specific program!). 
As a consequence it seems to be obvious that they should be related to, and delivered 
with the application frameworks they are intended to test. The build time file tree 
provides <strong>test frameworks</strong> that can contain any kind of programs 
and that contains, as any framework, an IdentityCard file specifying the tested 
application frameworks.</p>

<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Tests"></a>Tests Can Be Developed and Shared As Well As Programs</h3>
<p>Test programs can be as complex as any program, thus the same problems can be 
encountered: concurrent engineering, parallel development, and so on. Using the 
test framework, developers can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Build test programs: the software architecture which is supported for V6 
		programs is available for test programs as well. You can then use the generic 
		code builder mkmk [<a href="#References">1</a>] and structure your programs 
		using modules </li>
	<li>Exchange: any user is able to create and to deliver a test framework. Conversely, 
		any user can get a copy of an existing test framework, parallel developments 
		and concurrent engineering are allowed like for application frameworks
	</li>
	<li>Run everywhere: using predefined variables, observing some rules and delivering 
		test programs in test frameworks, you are able to execute them from any 
		workspace.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right"> [<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Predefined"></a>A Predefined Environment Eases the Development of Test 
Programs</h3>
<p>There are often two problems to address when developing test programs: on one 
hand, you must think of the way you&#39;ll test your application, and on the other 
hand you must set up the runtime environment and automate these tests. This second 
aspect has been studied and some solutions can be brought in the V6 scope:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tests are run by a particular command named mkodt [<a href="#References">2</a>] 
		that sets up the runtime environment both for your applications and for 
		your test programs themselves.</li>
	<li>Predefined directories and environment variables are available for test 
		programs to find external resources, such as input data, reference output, 
		and the like.</li>
	<li>The V6 infrastructure can be used whether tests are run on Unix or Windows 
		platforms. This is possible thanks to specific predefined variables that 
		are independent from the operating systems [<a href="#References">3</a>] 
		and by following some basic rules [<a href="#References">4</a>].</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Auto"></a>Tests Can Be Run Automatically</h3>
<p>The fact that test frameworks can be delivered along with application frameworks 
and that their test programs can be run automatically allow the automation of some 
test based certifications before code delivery.</p>

<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Inside"></a>Tests Are Run Inside a Workspace</h3>
<p>Tests always take place in a workspace and are used to check what is developed 
in this workspace, thus only programs and shared libraries that are visible in a 
workspace can be tested by test objects in this workspace. However, note that the 
concatenation feature brings visibility on what is managed among multiple workspaces.</p>
<p>Any test can be run either being under a workspace - the current working directory 
is under the workspace root directory - or by referencing a workspace. Both modes 
are specified through mkodt options [<a href="#References">2</a>]. One test object 
or all test objects can be run at user&#39;s convenience.</p>
<p>We&#39;d just like to give you an idea on how you can put in place some automatic 
tests in order to certify the quality of your software. Here is an example of an 
organization where several people are working on the same software, each of them 
owning a workspace from which he/she delivers pieces of software. Regarding the 
workspace hierarchy, we can see that all modifications must go through the <em>project</em> 
workspace. This <em>project</em> workspace is a place where automatic tests should 
be run each time there are some new modifications to promote outside the scope of 
this organization.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Workspace Hierarchy" height="186" src="images/CAARqc0001.png" width="376"/></p>
<p>Developers create applications and tests in their own workspaces, such as WS1, 
WS2, and WS2, and promote them to an integration workspace named Project. The BSF 
(Best So Far) root workspace can enforce the rule that each framework coming from 
Project has an associated test framework and that every test objects can be executed 
successfully. In addition, this BSF can be split into an application BSF and a 
test BSF to enables test run time view to be apart of the application run time 
view, and ease the application deployment.</p>

<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p>Rich Apps Unit Tester is dedicated to create and run test objects to test 
your programs and applications. The test objects share the same infrastructure 
than the applications. They can be run automatically or on demand, in any 
development or integration workspaces, and at any time during the development 
process. </p>
