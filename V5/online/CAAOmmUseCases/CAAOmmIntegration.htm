   <h3><a name="Learn"></a>What You Will Learn With This Use Case</h3>
   <p>This use case explains how to integrate a new feature so that any 
   OLE-based scripting language can create and use this feature. It shows how to 
   extend the default CATIA OLE model.</p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
   <h3><a name="UseCase"></a>The CAAOmm Use Case</h3>
   <p>CAAOmm use case implements a basic mechanical feature, <code>
   CAAOmmVerticalLine</code>, and provides all the 
   mandatory implementation to be fully OLE integrated. It illustrates IDL 
   interfaces design and MechanicalModeler OLE resources usage.</p>
   
   <p> The <code>CAAOmmVerticalLine</code> startup is defined in <code>CAAOmmCatalog.CATfct</code>
   file. It is derives from <code>GSMGeom</code> (SuperTypeName) which is declared public 
   and derivable in the CATHybridShape.CATSpecs file. 
   Our vertical line feature 
   has two &quot;in&quot; attributes, which are features (<i>tk_specobject</i>) from the 
   Vertical Line standpoint. They are actually be point features, hence their 
   name of &quot;Point 1&quot; and &quot;Point2&quot;.
</p>   
 
     <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
   
   <h4><a name="What"></a>What Does CAAOmm Do</h4>
   <p>CAAOmm includes a simple mechanical feature, drawing a vertical line from 
   a point and limited by the normal projection on another one in the XY plane.</p>
   <p>This feature is created by a Visual Basic script.</p>
   <p><b>Snapshot of the result</b></p>
   <p><img border="0" src="images/CAAOmmUseCaseSnapshot.jpg" width="447" height="320"></p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
   
   <h4><a name="How"></a>How to Launch CAAOmm</h4>
   <p>The sample contained in CAAOLE4MecMod.edu is intended to be used through a 
   Visual Basic Macro.</p>
   <p>First, you have:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>To compile the sample with mkmk -aug [<a href="#References">1</a>] </li>
     <li>To generate the runtime view with mkCreateRuntimeView [<a 
     href="#References">1</a>]</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Once all the modules contained in CAAOLE4MecMod.edu have been compiled, 
   you have to launch CATIA and properly configure the TypeLib: CATIA has to 
   know about the new OLE object contained in the sample TypeLib named 
   OmmTypeLib, this .tlb file is located under your workspace runtime view 
   (.../code/bin).</p>
   <p>Thus, you should import this library with the &quot;Option&quot; Menu such as shown 
   below.</p>
   <p><img border="0" src="images/CAAOmmSettings.jpg" width="600" height="417"></p>
   <p>Then you should execute the following macro thru the Tools menu:</p>
   <table class="code">
     <tr>
       <td>
       <pre>Language=&quot;VBSCRIPT&quot;

Sub CATMain()
  Dim doc0 As Document
  Set doc0 = CATIA.Documents.Add(&quot;Part&quot;)

  Dim body1 As HybridBody
  Set body1 = doc0.Part.HybridBodies.Add()

  Dim point1 As HybridShapePointCoord
  Set point1 = doc0.Part.HybridShapeFactory.AddNewPointCoord( 20., 50., 0. )
  body1.AppendHybridShape point1

  Dim point2 As HybridShapePointCoord
  Set point2 = doc0.Part.HybridShapeFactory.AddNewPointCoord( -30., 80., 0. )
  body1.AppendHybridShape point2

  doc0.Part.InWorkObject = point2
  doc0.Part.Update

  Dim Reference1 As Reference
  Set Reference1 = doc0.Part.CreateReferenceFromGeometry ( point1 )

  Dim Reference2 As Reference
  Set Reference2 = doc0.Part.CreateReferenceFromGeometry ( point2)

  Dim CustFact0 As Factory
  Set CustFact0 = doc0.Part.GetCustomerFactory(&quot;OmmFactory&quot;)

  Dim line1 As OmmVerticalLine
  Set line1 = CustFact0.AddNewVerticalLine( Reference1, Reference2 )
  body1.AppendHybridShape line1

  line1.Compute

   <h4><a name="Step1"></a>Designing the Exposed Model</h4>
   <p>Now that we have a brand new feature, we need to add some code around it 
   in order to integrate it within the world of automation objects that Shape 
   Design exposes. Here is a schematic view, expressed in UML, of the objects 
   involved in that process. The blue boxes depict the objects that we will add 
   as part of this use case.</p>
   <p><img border="0" src="images/CAAOmmUseCaseModel.jpg" width="722" height="632"></p>
   <p>Let us first isolate the objects in this schema that are directly exposed 
   to the automation world. Those are the ones whose name begins with &quot;CATIA&quot;.</p>
   <p>The CATIAPart is the top level automation object here. It aggregates a 
   collection of CATIAHybridBody, named CATHybridBodies, which in turn 
   aggregates a collection of CATIAHybridShape, names CATIAHybridShapes. This 
   implements the hierarchy of containers-and-objects that is classical in 
   automation:</p>
   <pre>Part
  HybridBodies
    HybridBody
      HybridShapes
        HybridShape</pre>
   <p>Underneath this hierarchy of automation objects, there is a parallel 
   hierarchy of features, that are not visible from automation, but actually 
   implement in the Mechanical Modeler what those automation objects can do. 
   These are:</p>
   <pre>MechanicalPart (corresponds to HybridBodies)
  GSMTool (corresponds to HybridBody and HybridShapes)
    GSMGeom (corresponds to HybridShape: any wireframe/surfacic element)</pre>
   <p>Last, the CATIAPart object can instantiate a CATIAFactory object (through 
   GetCustomerFactory()), which in turn can instantiate any automation object 
   that may be needed, in particular instances of CATIA HybridShape.</p>
   <p>What about adding our Vertical Line feature to this? What we have done so 
   far is creating a new feature with GSMGeom as father. This is the blue box in 
   the lower left corner.</p>
   <p>The first step is to enrich this feature so that it implements a newly 
   designed automation interface through which it can be manipulated from the 
   automation world. This interface is named CAAIAOmmVerticalLine (CAAIA is CAA 
   counterpart to CATIA as prefix for automation interfaces). This interface has 
   got four methods for manipulating the Vertical Line by the two points that 
   constrain it (blue box at bottom right). Since a Vertical Line is a kind of 
   HybridShape, the CAAIAOmmVerticalLine interface derives from the 
   CATIAHybridShape interface, so that all methods that apply to HybridShape 
   also apply to our line. The script sample for example uses 
   CATIAHybriShape::Compute to update the newly Created CAAOmmVerticalLine.</p>
   <p>Being a CATIAHybridShape also allows our feature to be put in the 
   collection of Hybrid Shapes of an Hybrid Body, allowing to retrieve it 
   through the same container-object access mechanism as the other Hybrid Shape 
   features. </p>
   <p>The code that implements this interface on the CAAOmmVerticalLine feature 
   is beared by an extension to it, named CAAEOmmVerticalLine (bottom center).</p>
   <p>As our newly created feature inherits from GSMGeom, it inherits mechanical 
   behaviors including an implementation for CATIAHybridShape.</p>
   <p>The last step consists in extending our automation model so that instances 
   of CAAIAOmmVerticalLine can actually be created. This is done by providing 
   another automation factory, called CAAIAOmmFactory. This factory's single 
   method, AddNewVerticalLine(), instantiates a CAAIAOmmVerticalLine.</p>
   <p>The implementation code for CAAIAOmmFactory is beared by the 
   CAAEOmmFactory class, which is an extension to the MechanicalPart Feature. 
   This is mandatory in order for your factory to be found at run time.</p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
   <h4><a name="Step2"></a>Creating IDL Interfaces</h4>
   <p>We are now going to implement the interfaces we need as designed in the 
   previous step. Since these interfaces are to be used in a variety of 
   programming languages, such as Visual Basic or JavaScript, it is not written 
   in a specific language, but in IDL (Interface Definition Language), a 
   language which is specific to the definition of interfaces that can be used 
   in a multi-languages environment. Here is the source file for the factory 
   interface:</p>
   <table class="code">
     <tr>
       <td>
       <pre>interface CAAIAOmmFactory : CATIAFactory
{
  HRESULT AddNewVerticalLine(in CATIAReference ipiReferenceOnPoint1,
                             in CATIAReference ipiReferenceOnPoint2,
                             out /*IDLRETVAL*/ CAAIAOmmVerticalLine opiVerticalLineOnLine);
};

// Interface name : CAAIOmmFactory
#pragma ID CAAIAOmmFactory &quot;DCE:c726e680-1538-11d4-9eea00508b675465&quot;
#pragma DUAL CAAIAOmmFactory

// VB object name : OmmFactory (Id used in Visual Basic)
#pragma ID OmmFactory &quot;DCE:c726e681-1538-11d4-9eea00508b675465&quot;
#pragma ALIAS CAAIAOmmFactory OmmFactory</pre>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The IDL is close to common object programming languages such as Java or 
   C++. Most noticeable differences are:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Argument direction (in, out) must be declared </li>
     <li>A special comment, /* IDLRETVAL */, can be inserted before the last out 
     argument of an interface. It allows this argument to be used as a lvalue in 
     an expression, like in</li>
   </ul>
   <table class="code">
     <tr>
       <td>
       <pre>...
  dim myLine as OmmVerticalLine;
  OmmVerticalLine = AddNewVerticalLine(PStart, PEnd);
...</pre>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The last four lines of the file are #pragmas, ie compiler directives. The 
   first #pragma (ID) is used to associate the interface name as defined for 
   human usage (&quot;OmmFactory&quot;) with a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier), which is 
   used by the system to unically indentify your interface. That way, even if 
   another interface is named OmmFactory elsewhere, no confusion can occur.</p>
   <p>The DUAL #pragma declares that this interface can be used in late binding 
   mode allowing access by automation controlers like VBScript.</p>
   <p>The ALIAS #pragma is a commodity pragma. It actually defines a shorter 
   name (&quot;OmmFactory&quot;) for the interface complete name (&quot;CAAIAOmmFactory&quot;). That 
   way, the entity represented by this interface can be handled in Visual Basic 
   with type &quot;OmmFactory&quot; instead of &quot;CAAIAOmmFactory&quot;), which improves the code 
   readability.</p>
   <p>Before being used, this alias should be declared as any other ID with a 
   GUID.</p>
   <p>You can find more information on the IDL language and the automation 
   mechanisms in [<a href="#References">2</a>] and [<a href="#References">4</a>].</p>
   <p>To complete the mechanism allowing to retrieve your factory, you need to 
   put the following line in a file suffixed .iid, in the dictionary. Here it's 
   called CAAOLE4MecMod.edu.iid.</p>
   <table class="code">
     <tr>
       <td>
       <pre>{c726e680-1538-11d4-9eea-00508b675465} CAAIAOmmFactory OmmFactory</pre>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>It contains the GUID of the automation class, its name and the name of the 
   feature that bears its implementation.</p>
   <table class="code">
     <tr>
       <td>
       <pre>interface CAAIAOmmVerticalLine : CATIAHybridShape
{
  #pragma PROPERTY Point1

  HRESULT get_Point1(out /*IDLRETVAL*/ CATIAReference opiReferenceOnPoint1);
  HRESULT put_Point1(in CATIAReference ipiReferenceOnPoint1);

  #pragma PROPERTY Point2
  HRESULT get_Point2(out /*IDLRETVAL*/ CATIAReference opiReferenceOnPoint2);
  HRESULT put_Point2(in CATIAReference ipiReferenceOnPoint2);
};

// Interface name : CAAIOmmVerticalLine
#pragma ID CAAIAOmmVerticalLine &quot;DCE:2ea944f0-1539-11d4-9eea00508b675465&quot;
#pragma DUAL CAAIAOmmVerticalLine

// VB object name : OmmVerticalLine (Id used in Visual Basic)
#pragma ID OmmVerticalLine &quot;DCE:2ea944f1-1539-11d4-9eea00508b675465&quot;
#pragma ALIAS CAAIAOmmVerticalLine OmmVerticalLine</pre>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The IDL code for the second interface follows the same rules, but 
   introduces one more #pragma, the PROPERTY #pragma. Such a #pragma must 
   precede two methods definitions whose signature is put_* and get_* 
   respectively. The two methods must have one argument, in and out 
   respectively, and the get_* method must qualify its argument with /* 
   IDLRETVAL */.</p>
   <p>Given those writing conventions, what you get is something that, despite 
   the fact that the interface is totally method-based and does not hold any 
   instance data by itself, appears to the scripting client as an instance data 
   beared by the interface (hence the name 'property'). As a result, such VBasic 
   code becomes possible:</p>
   <table class="code">
     <tr>
       <td>
       <pre>...
  dim myLine as OmmVerticalLine;
  dim PStart as Point;
  dim rPStart as Reference;
  rPStart = Pstart;
  myLine.Point1 = rPStart;
...</pre>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>What actually happens is an encapsulation by the interface of all the 
   calls to get_Point1 and put_Point1 that are necessary to place a reference on 
   PStart as the starting point for our OmmVerticalLine. The net result is a 
   much simpler and straightforward client VBasic code.</p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
   <h4><a name="Step3"></a>Creating a Type Library</h4>
   <p>IDL source is not used as is by the languages that use it as a medium to 
   resources programmed in other languages. It must be compiled first, and the 
   result of this compilation is called a <i>typelib</i>. Creating a typelib is 
   useful for two reasons:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>It allows the correctness of IDL source to be verified, producing 
     build-time errors, always better than run-time errors </li>
     <li>the typelib is a much more efficient interface information repository 
     that the raw IDL source for clients</li>
   </ol>
   <p>So, the next step is to compile our two interfaces into a typelib. 
   Creating a new typelib requires a little directives to be given to our IDL 
   compiler thanks to a couple of new #pragmas. Here is the source code for the 
   file containing those directives. This file has a .tlb extension and is to be 
   put in the src directory of a specific module whose Imakefile.mk type is 
   TYPELIB. Here it's called CAAIAOmmTypeLib.tlb in the CAAOllTypeLib.m module.</p>
   <table class="code">
     <tr>
       <td>
       <pre>#pragma REPID CAAOmm &quot;DCE:872b73b0-1538-11d4-9eea00508b675465&quot;
#pragma REPBEGIN CAAOmm

#pragma REPREQ InfTypeLib
#pragma REPREQ MecModTypeLib

#include &quot;CAAIAOmmVerticalLine.idl&quot;
#include &quot;CAAIAOmmFactory.idl&quot;

#pragma REPEND CAAOmm</pre>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The REPID #pragma names our typelib and assign it a GUID, just like we did 
   previously for interfaces and for the same reasons.</p>
   <p>The CAAOmm typelib code itself is comprised between the delimiting #pragmas 
   REPBEGIN and REPEND. It includes two sections:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>REPREQ #pragmas indicate that the newly defined typelib uses interfaces 
     previously defined in other typelibs (&quot;InfTypeLib&quot; and &quot;MecModTypeLib&quot;). 
     That way, definition of interfaces like CATIAReference can be used within 
     CAAOmm while being defined elsewhere. </li>
     <li>#include directives import in that typelib definition file the IDL 
     definition for the newly defined interfaces.</li>
   </ol>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
   <h4><a name="Step4"></a>Implementing IDL Interfaces</h4>
   <p>At this point, we are done with what is necessary to allow scripting 
   languages to access our C++ code for the VerticalLine feature, that is, IDL 
   interface definition and a typelib as their repository.</p>
   <p>What's next? The actual C++ implementation of the interfaces that we have 
   'promised' to the external world via the typelib. This is explained in six 
   steps:</p>
   <ol type="a">
     <li>Create a C++ class to implement the CAAIAOmmFactory interface </li>
     <li>Implement get_Name for this class </li>
     <li>Implement get_Parent for this class </li>
     <li>Implement the specific method of this interface: CreateVerticalLine
     </li>
     <li>Create a C++ class to implement the CAAIAOmmVerticalLine interface, and 
     implement get_Name and get_Parent for this class </li>
     <li>Implement the specific methods of this interface</li>
   </ol>
   <p>And this is what we are going to do now:</p>
   <ol type="a">
     <li>we start by the Ommfactory interface
     <table class="code">
       <tr>
         <td>
         <pre>...
#include &quot;TIE_CAAIAOmmFactory.h&quot;

                   CATBaseUnknown,

...</pre>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>The IDL compilation of our IDL interfaces has produced a 
     TIE_CAAIAOmmFactory.h C++ header file that we are going to use here for the 
     definition of methods that must be provided as implementations for the IDL 
     interface methods. CAAEOmmFactory is the name of the C++ class that we 
     provide as the implementation class for the IDL OmmFactory interface.</p>
     <p>As per our previous design (see <a href="#Step2">Designing The Exposed 
     Model</a> above), CAAEOmmFactory is an extension (CAA<b>E</b>) of the 
     MechanicalPart feature. We can now begin to implement its methods, 
     beginning by get_Name().</li>
     <li>We can now begin to implement its methods,beginning by get_Name().
     <table class="code">
       <tr>
         <td>
         <pre>...
HRESULT CAAEOmmFactory::get_Name(CATBSTR &amp; oName)
{
  // Instance is a singleton : name is the meta-class alias name
  CATUnicodeString str (&quot;<b>OmmFactory</b>&quot;);
  str.ConvertToBSTR(&amp;oName);
  return S_OK;
}
...</pre>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>Our factory must provide a get_Name() method because it inherits from 
     the anyObject interface through its CATIAFactory parent (in other words, 
     each scripting object must be able to name itself).</p>
     <p>As an extension of the MechanicalPartFeature feature that is unique 
     within a Part document, there will be only one CAAIOmmFactory per document. 
     We so choose to return always the same name: OmmFactory.</li>
     <li>There is another property that is common to all automation objects, the 
     Parent property. This is the goal of the next methods, still inherited from 
     anyObject interface.
     <table class="code">
       <tr>
         <td>
         <pre>...
HRESULT __stdcall CAAEOmmFactory::get_Parent(CATBaseDispatch *&amp;opiBaseOnOLEParent)
{
  HRESULT rc=QueryInterface(IID_CATIAPart, (void**) &amp;opiBaseOnOLEParent);
  return rc;
}
...</pre>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>The data model exposed through automation is basically an aggregation 
     model. As a result, every exposed object appears as aggregated within a 
     higher level entity: a part contains a collection of its bodies, within 
     which each body contains a collection of its features, and so on. The 
     exposed data model is therefore organized as a tree. For any node in that 
     tree, except the top node, the Parent property is expected to return the 
     aggregating node above its target object. This can sometimes make this 
     property non trivial to implement, if the actual underlying data model is 
     not organized as an aggregation model, as an automation client expects.</p>
     <p>Here the situation is not desperate, though. Since the OmmFactory can be 
     obtained from the Part through GetCustomerFactory(), and this is the only 
     path to the factory, the OmmFactory appears to be contained in the Part. 
     Therefore, when asked for its parent, the OmmFactory should return the Part 
     object.</p>
     <p>However, behind the scenes, ie in the C++ world, the OmmFactory and the 
     Part are actually one single object, or, more precisely, two extensions of 
     the same Object Modeler component, the Mechanical Part. Consequently, the 
     OmmFactory, to return its associated Part, returns itself cast to a 
     CATIAPart interface thanks to an appropriate QueryInterface().</li>
     <li>After paying this tribute to the Automation world by implementing 
     Parent and Name properties, we can now skip to the actual job of this 
     factory: instantiating VerticalLine feature objects. This longer method is 
     split is severel steps, here is the first one.

     <li>Now that the CAAIAOmmFactory is implemented, the next step is to 
     implement the CAAIAOmmVerticalLine interface itself. The first section of 
     this implementation consists in providing code for the standard get_Name()

      ipSpecObjectOnThis-&gt;Release();
      ipSpecObjectOnThis = NULL ;

      while ((NULL != pParent) &amp;&amp; (NULL == opiBaseOnOLEParent)) 
      {
         CATISpecObject * pParentCurrent = pParent ;
         rc =  pParentCurrent-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_<b>CATIAHybridShapes</b>, (void**) &amp;opiBaseOnOLEParent);

         pParent =  pParentCurrent -&gt; GetFather();

         pParentCurrent-&gt;Release();
         pParentCurrent = NULL ;
      }
   }
   return rc;
}
...</pre>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>The name of the object is retrieved in a standard way by querying it for 
     the support of CATIAlias, the standard naming interface, and using its 
     GetAlias() method for retrieving the actual name.</p>
     <p>The get_Parent() method is implemented by using the parent-child 
     relationship contained in the feature modeler. As any feature, our Vertical 
     Line implements the <i>CATISpecObject</i> interface. This interface 
     provides the GetFather() method that returns the mechanical feature 
     aggregating for <i>this.</i></p>
     <p>However, this direct parent may not be a suitable parent for the 
     automation world. Remember, the automation world presents a data model that 
     is often simpler than the actual underlying data modeler. In this case, 
     what aggregates the Vertical Line in the automation view that we want to 
     provide is a collection of Hybrid Shapes. In the underlying model, the 
     object that correspond to this collection may exist not only as a direct 
     parent to the Vertical Line, but also as its ancestor up the parent-chidren 
     tree.</p>
     <p>This is why we iterate from parent to grand parent, etc., in the last 
     section of this code, until an object implementing CATIAHybridShapes is 
     finally found, and we return it as the father for our Vertical Line.</li>
     <li>The next methods to implements are the methods for getting and putting 
     the points that are the input specs for our line. Here is the code for 
     put_Point1(), the three others being very similar:
     <table class="code">
       <tr>
         <td>
         <pre>...
HRESULT __stdcall CAAEOmmVerticalLine::put_Point1(CATIAReference * ipiReferenceOnPoint1)
{
   HRESULT rc=E_FAIL;

   <b>CATISpecAttrAccess</b> * piSpecAttrAccessOnThis=NULL;
   rc=QueryInterface(IID_CATISpecAttrAccess, (void**) &amp;piSpecAttrAccessOnThis);
   ...

   <b>CATISpecAttrKey</b>* piAttrKeyOnSpec = piSpecAttrAccessOnThis-&gt;<b>GetAttrKey</b>(&quot;Point1&quot;);
   ...

   CATISpecObject_var spSpecOnPoint1;
   rc = ::<b>GetSpecFromReference</b> (ipiReferenceOnPoint1, spSpecOnPoint1); 
   ...

   piSpecAttrAccessOnThis-&gt;<b>SetSpecObject</b>(piAttrKeyOnSpec,spSpecOnPoint1);
   ...
   return rc;
}</pre>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>We begin by retrieving a pointer of <i>CATISpecAttrAccess</i>, on <i>
     this, </i>ie the Vertical Line. Then we use it to access the &quot;Point1&quot; 
     attribute.&nbsp;</p>
     <p>In this method we get the input point ipiReferenceOnPoint1 not as a 
     feature, but as a CATIAReference. CATIAReferences are used because they 
     provide a stable handle onto objects that are manipulated within scripts, 
     whether those objects represent actual underlying model objects or only 
     part of them. So we convert the reference into a real Feature through a 
     call to <code>GetSpecFromReference</code>(), which manages the link from a 
     reference to its referent.</p>
     <p>The last step consists in assigning the feature we got from 
     GetSpecFromReference() as attribute to the vertical line.</li>
   </ol>

   <h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
   <p>This article explains what has to be done in order to integrate a new 
   feature added to a CATIA application to the automation exposed view for that 
   application. As a result, the new feature can be manipulated as the native 
   features from within scripting environments such as Visual Basic.</p>
   <p>The first step is to 'plug' the new feature and its associated factory as 
   new automation interfaces in the application automation model. From there, 
   where those new behaviors should be implemented in the underlying, actual 
   application model can be deduced.</p>
   <p>Then, automation interfaces for the new feature and its factory are 
   written using the IDL language, and appropriate dictionary declaration is 
   produced. Some more additional IDL code gathers those new IDL objects 
   definitions within a source code TypeLib, which is compiled into an 
   executable TypeLib that will be used by scripting languages for knowing about 
   those new types at run time.</p>
   <p>The last part consists in implementing the new IDL interfaces in the 
   underlying model. In addition to the methods defined in the interfaces 
   themselves, the implementations must provide code for methods get_Name() and 
   get_Parent(), that all automation objects must implement. Thanks to 
   get_Parent(), the exposed automation model can appear as having a 
   parent-child structure which is somehow different (and most often, simpler) 
   than the one existing in the underlying model.</p>
