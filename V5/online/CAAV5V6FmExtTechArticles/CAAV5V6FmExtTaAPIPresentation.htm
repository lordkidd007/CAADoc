<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>feature</strong> is  a key entity  of the Feature modeler, a fundamental building block of a feature data model. A 
<strong>feature</strong> represents  data typically characterized by attributes [<a href="#References">1</a>], and behavior. 
</p>
<p>An <strong>attribute</strong>  is either a  primitive type ( double, Boolean,..), or a link type.  A primitive type is defined in 
standard programming languages while a link type, is prevalent only within the Feature Modeler,   since it facilitates linking a feature to another feature or a PLM Object, a need specific to the Feature Modeler domain.  
</p>
<p>A feature,  is   created from a <strong>StartUp</strong> [<a href="#References">2</a>], which may be considered as a &#8220;feature template&#8221;, although a feature itself  can serve as a reference, for further feature instantiations. StartUps 
are defined in feature catalogs found in specific directories, which are runtime 
accessible.

</p>
<p>Creating a feature implies instantiating it inside a <strong>Container</strong> [<a href="#References">3</a>]. A 
<strong>Container</strong> is a feature modeler entity which facilitates feature persistency.
  
</p>
<p>We also introduce the <strong>Credential</strong> object [<a href="#References">4</a>]. 
In the secured feature access context, it is this object which authorizes access 
to and working with the features (StartUps).&nbsp; A <strong>Credentials</strong> 
object infact works in conjunction with another object namely a <strong>Facade</strong>. A
<strong>Facade</strong> is an enveloping class, bound to an 
underlying feature and associated with the right Credentials, thus providing a 
controlled access to the underlying feature.</p>

<h2><a name="Main feat"></a>Main Feature Entities</h2>
<p>We detail the main feature entities in the sections that follow.</p>
<h3><a name="Credential"></a>Credential</h3>
<p>The <strong>Credential</strong> [<a href="#References">4</a>] object is a 
feature modeler entity which plays a key role in the&nbsp; secured feature 
access mechanism. It authorizes instantiating a feature (StartUp), scanning a 
container for its features etc. Infact, a feature is handled by a Facade object, 
detailed further below, which is bound to an underlying feature and is 
associated with the appropriate credentials.</p>
<p>A Credentials object is represented by the <em>CATFmCredentials</em> class. A 
single credential object could be appended with all credentials, required by the 
client applications, akin to a key chain which may have several keys in it.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="StartUp"></a>StartUp</h3>
<p>A <strong>StartUp</strong> [<a href="#References">2</a>] is a &#8220;feature template&#8221;, implying it contains the feature definition in it. It typically occurs in a feature catalog.

</p>
<p>In the secured feature access environment, a user is forbidden direct access 
to the Startup. Instead it is handled by an enveloping <em>CATFmStartUpFacade</em> 
class. As the name itself signifies, the class could be considered as a facade 
over the underlying feature (in this case, StartUp). </p>
<p>The authorization to instantiate the underlying StartUp is sought 
from the Credentials associated with the facade class. As a result, the <em>
CATFmStartUpFacade</em> class object is created with the StartUp late type and the required 
Credentials, as key input. This object can then calls the <em>Instantiate()</em> 
method</p>
<p>It is significant to note here that the underlying StartUp feature is never 
directly accessible to the client applications, since a StartUp is accessed 
solely to instantiate a feature from it, which is accomplished using the 
services exposed by the StartUp facade class.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="Feature"></a>Feature</h3>
<p>A F<strong>eature</strong> is an entity around which the entire 
feature Modeler world revolves. It is handled with a class named 
<em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em> and defined by the Feature Modeler.</p>
<p>Unlike a StartUp, you can have direct access to the feature bound to a facade, but access is limited, 
since the feature is retrieved simply as a <em>CATBaseUnknown</em> type, devoid 
of credentials thus prohibiting an end-user to fully access and work with the 
underlying feature, except of course if your feature implements an Interface of 
its own.</p>
<p>The methods of a feature facade that succeed only if the facade is 
associated with the required, credentials can broadly be classified into the 
different orientations&nbsp; listed below:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Identity</strong>:  to retrieve its type,  its reference, its startup [<a href="#References">2</a>] and to manage the naming [<a href="#References">5</a>]</li>
	<li><strong>Location</strong>: to retrieve its parent, root parent, 
	Container, Rep Ref</li>
	<li><strong>Feature extension</strong>: to add, remove, retrieve feature extension on the current feature, commonly referred to as the base feature [<a href="#References">6</a>]
	</li>
	<li><strong>Attribute Management</strong> : to get and set an attribute value (there are specific methods to manage list 
	attributes) [<a href="#References">1</a>]
	</li>
	<li><strong>Lifecycle</strong>: creation ( from a feature), and deletion [<a href="#References">7</a>]
	</li>
	<li><strong>Update</strong> [<a href="#References">8</a>]
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
	</li>
</ul>
<p>In your applications, you may use the same Feature Facade object repeatedly, 
thus binding it to a different feature each time. This is typically useful, 
while you iterate through a feature iterator, thus retrieving a new feature in 
the same feature facade, each time.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="Attribute"></a>Attribute</h3>
<p>A Feature <strong>Attribute</strong> [<a href="#References">1</a>] value is retrieved as a <em>CATFmAttributeValue</em> 
type. It is significant to note that the Credentials are relevant only until an 
attribute value is retrieved from a feature. Analysing this attribute value 
thereafter, is independent of the credentials held by the client.<p>A single <em>
CATFmAttributeValue</em> class could be used to store the value across all 
attribute types. 
The actual values are then retrieved with calls to the <em>CATFmAttributeValue</em> 
services, which exist for each attribute type.<p>An attribute is identified by its name, represented by a <em>CATFmAttributeName</em>
class equivalent for it. From an end-user&#8217;s point of view, an attribute name 
could simply have been a basic string, while the Feature Modeler, has defined an 
equivalent class, for it. This is because, compared to a string, a class 
improves the efficiency in terms of speed and simplicity in the 
operations involving feature attribute access.</p>  
<p>The main methods of the <em>CATFmAttributeValue</em> 
class are :</p>
<ul>
	<li>To retrieve the value as a basic (C++) type</li>
	<li>To retrieve attribute information like attribute type, 
	valuated/non-valuated, list/non-list, set/unset, valuation mode etc</li>
	<li>To valuate a feature attribute, irrespective of its type</li>
</ul>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Container"></a>Container
</h3>
<p>A <strong>Container</strong>[<a href="#References">3</a>] is an object modeler entity for storing 
data and thus facilitating data persistency. A Container of features is the only 
CAA exposed one. As a result the Feature Modeler defines the <em>
CATFmContainerFacade</em> class, to specifically handle a Container object in 
the CAA environment.</p>
<p>Usually you work with an existing container, defined by the DS Modelers, but your application can also create its applicative container [<a href="#References">3</a>] for its own usage.

</p>
<p>An object of a <em>CATFmContainerFacade</em> class, can be bound to different Containers during its lifetime. You can have direct access to the Container bound to a facade, but access is limited, 
since the Container is retrieved simply as a 
<em>CATBaseUnknown</em> type, devoid of credentials, thus prohibiting an 
end-user to fully access and work with the Container, except of course if your 
Container implements an Interface of its own. The main methods of the <em>CATFmContainerFacade</em>  are primarily those 
used to scan its contents.
