<h2><a name="Definition"></a>Definition</h2>
<p>A topological operator operates on topological objects to create new ones. Most 
of the time, these topological objects are bodies (a body is a set of connected 
(or not) volumes, faces, edges and vertices, see <a href="#References">[1]</a>). 
It never modifies the input bodies: the resulting body is a new one, but it can 
share cells with the input bodies, if they are not modified by the operation. This 
is called the smart concept (see <a href="#References">[2]</a>). On request, the 
operator can describe the way to go from the initial objects, to the resulting body. 
This information is then put by each operator into a CGM journal.</p>
<p>The CGM journal records the creation, modification and deletion of the faces, 
free edges and free vertices of topological objects. A free edge is an edge bounding 
at most one face, and a free vertex is a vertex bounding at most one edge. In fact, 
it is sufficient to follow the modifications of these cells to know how the whole 
body has been modified. The journal is attached to any topological or geometric 
operators that operate on topological objects.</p>
<p>The CGM journal is transient. You have to create it before its use and delete 
it when you have finished. It is possible to compress it to easy its reading.</p>
<p>In addition to this article, you can find a dedicated use case
<a href="#References">[3]</a>, that illustrates the way to read the journal.</p>

<h3><a name="Structure"></a>Journal Structure</h3>
<p>The CGM journal is built as a composite pattern: a journal is a hierarchy of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Item</strong>s, that are the leaves.</li>
	<li><strong>List</strong>s of lists and items.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Item"></a>Item Structure</h3>
<p>An item is an elementary line of a journal, describing what happens for a given 
cell.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each item has a type:
	<dl>
		<dt>Creation</dt>
		<dd>A new cell appears in the resulting body, built from an (optional) set 
		of cells of the input body.</dd>
		<dt>Deletion</dt>
		<dd>The cell disappears in the resulting body.</dd>
		<dt>Modification</dt>
		<dd>The cell that is used do not appear in the resulting body, and is replaced 
		by a new one.</dd>
		<dt>Subdivision</dt>
		<dd>Kind of modification where the cell is cut in several parts that appear 
		in the resulting body.</dd>
		<dt>Absorption</dt>
		<dd>Kind of modification where several cells are merged in the resulting 
		body.</dd>
	</dl>
	</li>
	<li>An item points to the topological cells of the input bodies that have been 
	modified, if any: in case of an absorption, several cells can be merged.</li>
	<li>An item points to the resulting topological cells: in case of a subdivision, 
	several cells can appear.</li>
	<li>An item offers a field for an optional information, used by each operator 
	to give additional details. This can be, as examples, the ribbon number for 
	a fillet surface or the type of face (bottom, top, lateral) for a prism. Each 
	operator publishes the way it uses the optional information.</li>
</ul>

<p>To clearly understand the difference between the creation and modification type, 
let us take an example.</p>

		type.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Imagine now you have put a color on the curve C1 of the profile. You 
		do not want that the faces F1, F5 and F6 still keeps this color: in fact,

		blue? That is the meaning of the creation item.</td>

<p>For each operator, the choice of the creation or modification type has been designed 
according to the needs of the applications.</p>

<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Copy or No Copy Mode"></a>Copy or No Copy Mode</h3>
<p>The copy or no copy mode is a default that the operator takes about the writing 
of its journal. Take an empty journal as an input of an operator for which you have 
asked to fill it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the copy mode, the operator supposes that all the cells of the input 
	bodies are in the resulting body. Let us consider the Boolean union of two bodies, 
	such that their intersection is empty. After such an union, if the union operator 
	is in copy mode (and it fact, it is the way it does), nothing is written into 
	the journal: according to the copy mode, all the cells are renewed by default, 
	and none of them are modified. because the particular position of the two bodies.</li>
	<li>With the no copy mode, the operator supposes that none of the cells of the 
	input bodies are in the resulting body. If you take the same union of the two 
	non intersecting bodies and if the union operator worked in no copy mode, there 
	would be as many creation item as there are faces, free vertices and edges in 
	the two initial bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This mode also has an influence on the item types that an operator uses to write 
its items. In fact, in case of copy mode, the operator writes, in general, more 
modification item type than it does in case of no copy mode. In case of no copy 
mode, on the contrary, it uses more creation items. The copy and no-copy mode as 
well as the detailed items is published by each operator.</p>

<h2><a name="Use"></a>Examples of Use</h2>
<p>We first describe the use of the topological journal for the object naming. Then, 
we illustrate its use for the selection. The last part discusses on the behavior 
differences between the creation and modification types. The journal is written 
for the applications. It is the reason why these examples are taken in the field 
of applications to do not belong to the CGM offering.</p>

<h3><a name="Follow-up"></a>Naming</h3>
<p>The CGM journal makes it possible to build a logical identifier on the generated 
cells.</p>
<p>Imagine that each curve of a profile has a logical name such as <code>Curve1</code>, 
..., <code>CurveN</code>. Now, extrude the profile along a direction to build a 
pad. The resulting face of the extrusion of the i-th curve of the profile can be 
named, using the information of the corresponding topological operation, as
<code>Pad1_Lateral_From_CurveI</code>.</p>
<p>Now, the user changes the definition of <code>Curve_I</code> (a circle radius, 
or replaces the curve), but keeps it attached to the same label <code>Curve_I</code>. 
If the prism operation is replayed, the result changes but all the logical names 
remain the same. All information attached to a logical name is still available on 
the new resulting body.</p>
<p>This principle is used by the Generic Naming to label the objects. In turn, the 
object names are used by the feature applications to record the order of the different 
topological operations. This is a main difference between the CGM modeler and the 
Feature modeler: the Feature modeler records the history of the operations, whereas 
the CGM modeler gives a transient information at the run of the operator.</p>

		<td>Following the items of the topological journal, the generic naming is 
		able to propose logical names, such that a modification of a physical object 
		(C2) attach to a logical name (<code>Curve_2</code>) does not modify the 
		logical names of the derived objects (<code>Pad1_lateral_From_Curve_2</code>). 
		Information attached to the logical objects are then stable if the operations 
		are replayed in the same order.</td>

<h3><a name="Highlight">Selection</a></h3>
<p>Take the pad of <a href="#Fig. 3">Fig. 3</a> and split it by a plane as on
<a href="#Fig. 4">Fig. 4</a>. It is possible to explore the CGM journal and go back 
from the last created face G2 to the initial face of the Pad that has been modified. 
It is then possible to have a way of selection which leads to the selection of the 
initial Pad, by selecting a face of another topological object that has been build 
from this Pad, which is useful when you want to modify a parameter of the initial 
prism.</p>

</a>Influence of the Creation or Modification Item Type on the Behavior of an Operator</h3>
<p>On the CGM point on view, the choice of the creation or modification type could 
have been arbitrary done. Now, this type acts on the behavior of the operator, when 
it is replayed in a context of an application using the naming, such as the mechanical 
modeler. So, the type has been chosen to lead to a behavior as close as possible 
to the expectations of the applications.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Fig. 5: Influence of the creation or modification type: case of a pocket 
	operation</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="images/CAACgmTopTopoJournal5.gif" alt="Pocket Operation" width="479" height="359"></td>
		<td valign="top">Take first a pad, and fillet one of its edge. The faces 
		H1 and H2 come from the modification of F1 and F2.
		<p>Now, insert a pocket operation just before the fillet operation, and 
		replay the operations: pad, pocket, fillet.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the faces G1, G2 and G3 were stamped as created, it were not 
			possible to go back to the initial faces, and the edges are not filleted. 
			This behavior is not desired by the application, it is the reason why 
			this choice is not taken for a Boolean operation.</li>
			<li>On the contrary, if the faces G1, G2 and G3 are stamped as modified, 
			it is possible to go back to the initial faces F1 and F2, and then filleting 
			all the edges having F1 and F2 as ancestors.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In this case, the application wants to keep the filleting of the resulting edges, 
so that the pocket operation (a Boolean subtraction) stamped the faces as modified. 
On the contrary, a shell operation is an example of creation mode.</p>
<table>

	operation</caption>

		<img src="images/CAACgmTopTopoJournal6.gif" alt="Shell Operation" width="479" height="359"></td>
		<td>Take the filleted Pad of the preceding example, and insert a shell 
		operation instead of a pocket operation. The balloon shows how the shell 
		operator operates: it blows the initial faces (such as F2) with a distance 
		e1, leading to new faces (such as J2), and also shrinks the initial faces 
		with a distance e2, leading to new faces (such as K2)
		<ul>
			<li>If the faces J2 and K2 were stamped as modified from the face F2, 
			the fillet operator would fillet them both, leading to potential impossible 
			configurations. Moreover, it is not what is expected by the applications 
			in this case.</li>
			<li>So, the operator stamps them as created. The fillet operation is 
			not replayed. If the user wants to have the face J2 filleted, it has 
			to run a new fillet operation.</li>
