		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>This article discusses the <code>CAAV5V6FmExtUnderstandingSynchro</code> 
		use case. A feature component attribute is not inherited, as the other 
		attributes are. This is because a component attribute valuation results 
		in an aggregation of a feature under the parent feature. Since a feature 
		can be aggregated essentially only under a single parent feature, a 
		component attribute value cannot be inherited.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>This use case is an illustration of the concepts described by the &quot;<strong>Understanding 
		Component Synchronization</strong>&quot; [<a href="#References">1</a>] 
		article.</p>
		<p>An understanding of the <strong>Feature-Instance</strong> model (by a 
		study of the technical article &quot;<strong>Feature Modeler Concepts</strong> 
		&quot; [<a href="#References">2</a>]) and that of component-type attributes 
		(by a study of the technical article on &quot;<strong>Understanding Feature 
		Attributes</strong>&quot; [<a href="#References">3</a>]) is recommended

<h2><a name="Learn"></a>What You Will Learn With This Use Case</h2>
<p>The Use Case illustrates to an end-user the fundamental concepts involved in 
synchronizing a feature instance attribute of type component with its reference. The attributes 
are of type component and component-list, which implies the synchronization 
actually involves an update of the features aggregated under the feature.</p>

<h2><a name="UseCase"></a>The CAAV5V6FmExtUnderstandingSynchro Use Case</h2>
<p><code>CAAV5V6FmExtUnderstandingSynchro </code>is a use case of the 
<code>CAAV5V6FeatureModelerExt.edu</code> framework 
that illustrates <code>FeatureModelerExt</code> framework capabilities.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="What"></a>What Does CAAV5V6FmExtUnderstandingSynchro Do</h3>
<p>The UC illustrates synchronization of a feature attribute. Primarily we deal 
with two types of attributes namely. <strong>component</strong> and <strong>
component list</strong>. Since we deal with component type attributes, we are 
fundamentally dealing with aggregated features. This further involves two cases 
that of immediate aggregation and that of a recursive aggregation.</p>
<p>The UC defines 3 distinct scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="#Case 1: Feature with component type attributes (Immediate aggregation of features under a parent feature)">Feature with component type attributes 
(Immediate aggregation of features under a parent feature)</a></li>
	<li>
	<a href="#Case 2: Feature with component-list type attributes (Immediate aggregation of a list of features under a parent feature)">Feature with component-list type attributes 
(Immediate aggregation of a list of features under a parent feature)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Case 3: Synchronizing of feature attributes is not recursive">Synchronizing of feature attributes is not 
recursive</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this<strong>
</strong>use case all StartUps are defined in the following catalog :<code>
CAAFmExtCatalogForUnderstandingSynchro.CATfct. </code>By convention</p>
<ul>
	<li>A is either an instance of
<strong>CAAFmExt_A_withCompAttr, or CAAFmExt_A_CAAFmExt_A_withListCompAttr</strong>&nbsp; 
	or <strong>CAAFmExt_Arec</strong> (the scenario specifies it)</li>
	<li><strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D, E, F, G, H, I , J , U, V 
	, W, </strong>and<strong> X </strong>&nbsp;are respectively&nbsp; instances of
	<strong>CAAFmExt_B , CAAFmExt_C, ...&nbsp; </strong>. </li>
	<li><strong>A'</strong> is an instance of <strong>A</strong> , <strong>B</strong>' 
	is an instance of <strong>B</strong>, ....</li>
	<li><strong>A''</strong> an instance of <strong>A'</strong> , <strong>B</strong>'' 
	is an instance of <strong>B'</strong>, ....</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets us describe in details each scenario.</p>
<h4><strong>
<a name="Case 1: Feature with component type attributes (Immediate aggregation of features under a parent feature)">
</a>Case 1</strong>: <strong>Feature with component type attributes 
(Immediate aggregation of features under a parent feature)</strong></h4>
<p>The UC executes on a feature model depicted in [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>] 
that follows. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<table>
	<caption class="style4"><a name="Fig.1"></a>Fig.1 Input Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="../CAAV5V6FmExtTechArticles/images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig2.png" width="247" height="166">&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>A</strong>, a
<strong>CAAFmExt_A_withCompAttr</strong> startup instance, aggregates <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>,
<strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> realized by valuating its 
attributes <strong>attr1</strong>, <strong>attr2</strong>, <strong>attr3</strong> 
and <strong>attr4</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On instantiating <strong>A</strong>, it results in <strong>A'</strong>, 
as depicted in [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>]. <strong>A'</strong> now aggregates <strong>B'</strong>, <strong>
C'</strong>, <strong>D'</strong> and <strong>E'. </strong>A 
significant point to note here is that the aggregated features under the 
instantiated feature <strong>A'</strong>, are distinct from those aggregated under the 
reference feature <strong>A</strong>. This is owing to the fact that a feature can be 
aggregated only under a single parent feature. Hence instantiating a parent 
feature results in instantiation of the aggregated features as well.</p>
<p>Next, the model is modified as depicted in the [<a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>] 
that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption class="style4" style="width: 237px"><a name="Fig.2"></a>Fig. 2 Model for Synchronization</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="../CAAV5V6FmExtTechArticles/images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig3.png" width="246" height="189"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>A</strong> is updated by </p>
<ul>
	<li>Deleting <strong>B</strong>, which was aggregated under it</li>
	<li>Replacing <strong>D</strong> with <strong>U</strong>, aggregated under it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A'</strong> is updated by</p>
<ul>
	<li>Deleting <strong>C'</strong>, which was aggregated under it</li>
	<li>Replacing <strong>E'</strong> with <strong>V</strong>, aggregated under it</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus now we arrive at a feature model where our Feature Reference is 
asynchronous with the Feature Instance. On synchronization of <strong>&nbsp;A'</strong> attributes, the resulting model&nbsp; is as depicted in [<a href="#Fig.3">Fig. 
3</a>] below. It results in an update of <strong>A'</strong> which now 
aggregates instances of features aggregated under <strong>A</strong>, if 
those exist, realized by valuating each of the feature attributes. If a feature 
attribute on the reference side does not aggregate a feature, it reflects on the 
instance side as well, realized by destroying the corresponding feature 
aggregated.</p>
<table>
	<caption class="style4" style="width: 186px"><a name="Fig.3"></a>Fig.3 
	Synchronized Model</caption>

	</tr>
</table>
<p>You'll observe thus that <strong>A'</strong> update results in</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>B'</strong>, aggregated under it is destroyed. This is 
	because <strong>A</strong> currently does not aggregate a feature under 
	it, by realizing the valuation of its attribute <strong>attr1</strong>.&nbsp; 
	As a result, <strong>A'</strong> attribute <strong>attr1</strong> on 
	synchronization reflects the same state as that of <strong>A</strong>. This results in 
	destroying the <strong>B'</strong> feature, aggregated beneath <strong>A'</strong>, realized by its 
	attribute <strong>attr1</strong> valuation</li>
	<li><strong>C''</strong> is a new feature aggregated under <strong>A'</strong> on 
	synchronization, realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr2</strong>. This happens 
	since <strong>A' attr2</strong> attribute is valuated, on synchronization, so as to 
	realize the aggregation of a new instance of <strong>C</strong>, which is an aggregation 
	under <strong>A</strong>, realized by the valuation of its attribute 
	<strong>attr2</strong></li>
	<li><strong>U'</strong> is a new feature aggregated under <strong>A'</strong>, 
	realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr3</strong>. This happens since on 
	synchronization of attribute <strong>attr3</strong> of <strong>A'</strong>, it is valuated such as to 
	realize the aggregation of a new instance of <strong>U</strong>, the feature aggregated 
	under <strong>A</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr3</strong></li>
	<li><strong>E''</strong> is a new feature aggregated under <strong>A'</strong>, 
	realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr4</strong>. This happens 
	since on synchronization of attribute <strong>attr4</strong> of <strong>A'</strong>, it is valuated such as to realize the aggregation of new 
	instance of <strong>E</strong>, the feature aggregated under <strong>A</strong>, 
	realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we proceed to illustrate synchronization of a feature attribute of type 
component list.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h4><strong>
<a name="Case 2: Feature with component-list type attributes (Immediate aggregation of a list of features under a parent feature)">
</a>Case 2</strong>: <strong>Feature with component-list type attributes 
(Immediate aggregation of a list of features under a parent feature)</strong></h4>
<p>The UC here illustrates the concept of synchronization for a feature 
attribute of type <strong>component-list</strong>. One such feature <strong>A</strong>, 
a is 
as depicted below [<a href="#Fig.4">Fig. span class="style5">4</span></a>]]. </p>

<p><strong>A, </strong>a<strong> CAAFmExt_A_withListCompAttr, </strong>aggregates </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr1</strong></li>
	<li><strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr2</strong></li>
	<li><strong>F</strong> and <strong>G</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr3</strong></li>
	<li><strong>H</strong> and <strong>I</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On instantiating <strong>A</strong>, it results in <strong>A'</strong>, as depicted in [<a href="#Fig.4">Fig.4</a>] 
above. </p>
<p><strong>A'</strong> now aggregates instances of all features that are 
aggregated under its reference <strong>A</strong>. Moreover the aggregation 
is realized by valuating the same attributes on the instance side, as those that 
exist on the reference side. It is worthwhile re-emphasizing here that the 
aggregated features on the reference and instance side are distinct, since a 
feature can be aggregated essentially under a single parent, at any given point 
of time.</p>
<p>Now the UC proceeds to illustrate the impact of synchronization on an 
attribute of type <strong>component-list </strong>of a feature instance. To 
begin with, the <strong>A</strong> and <strong>A'</strong> are modified as depicted in [<a href="#Fig.5">Fig.<span class="style5">5</span></a>] 
below.</p>

	<caption class="style4" style="width: 247px"><a name="Fig.5"></a>Fig.5 Model for Synchronization</caption>

		<img alt="" src="../CAAV5V6FmExtTechArticles/images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig6.png" width="445" height="187"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The modification consists of </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>A</strong> now aggregates <strong>U</strong>, as well, realized by updating the value of 
	its attribute <strong>attr1</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A'</strong> now aggregates <strong>W</strong>, as well, realized by updating the value 
	of its attribute <strong>attr2</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A</strong> now aggregates <strong>V</strong> and 
	<strong>V'</strong> aggregates <strong>X</strong>, both 
	realized by updating the value of their attribute <strong>attr3</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A</strong> no longer aggregates <strong>J</strong>, which is eventually destroyed</li>
</ul>
<p>With those changes to our basic feature model, we now proceed to synchronize 
all attributes of&nbsp; <strong>A'</strong>. This synchronization results 
in an update of our feature model as depicted in the [<a href="#Fig.6">Fig.<span class="style5">6</span></a>] 
that follows.</p>

<p>On Synchronization of each attribute of <strong>A'</strong>, it results in</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>A'</strong> now aggregates <strong>U'</strong> (an instance of 
	<strong>U</strong>, on the reference 
	side) as well, realized by an update of its attribute <strong>attr1</strong> valuation</li>
	<li><strong>A'</strong> which had explicitly aggregated <strong>W</strong> under it, 
	pre-synchronization, remains intact post-synchronization</li>
	<li><strong>A'</strong> now also aggregates <strong>V'</strong> (an instance of
	<strong>V</strong>, on the 
	reference side) under it, realized by an update of its attribute <strong>attr3</strong> 
	valuation. An important point to note here is that <strong>X</strong> explicitly 
	aggregated by <strong>A'</strong>, realized by updating the valuation of the same 
	attribute <strong>attr3</strong>, remains intact. Another significant point to note is that 
	the order of the aggregated features under the feature instance, are those 
	under the feature reference followed by those under the feature instance, 
	essentially in that order. Hence <strong>V'</strong> precedes <strong>X</strong>, in the list</li>
	<li><strong>A'</strong> no longer aggregates <strong>J'</strong>, which is eventually destroyed, 
	since <strong>J</strong>, no longer exists on the reference side and synchronization 
	merely reflects this state on the instance side, as well</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>
<a name="Case 3: Synchronizing of feature attributes is not recursive"></a>Case 3</strong>: <strong>Synchronizing of feature attributes is not 
recursive</strong></h4>
<p>Consider the model below [<a href="#Fig.7">Fig.7</a>]. It consists of <strong>A</strong>, 
a <strong>CAAFmExt_Arec</strong> Startup Instance, which aggregates 
<strong>B </strong>(a<strong> </strong><strong>CAAFmExt_Brec</strong> ), realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr1</strong>. Further
<strong>B</strong> aggregates 
<strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute 
<strong>attr2</strong>. Thus, finally we 
achieve here a recursive aggregation under the parent <strong>A</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>A</strong> is instantiated which results in <strong>A'</strong>. 
The resulting <strong>A'</strong> aggregates <strong>B'</strong> which 
in turn aggregates, <strong>D'</strong> and <strong>E'</strong>. The 
features aggregated beneath <strong>A'</strong> are instances of corresponding features 
aggregated under <strong>A</strong>. The instantiation is mandatory owing to the fact that 
an aggregated feature can have only a single parent feature.</p>
<p>We proceed to modify this model [<a href="#Fig.8">Fig.8</a>], to illustrate 
the impact of synchronization in the steps ahead.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <strong>D</strong> aggregated under <strong>B</strong> is deleted. Next, 
we call synchronization of the attribute <strong>attr1</strong> of <strong>A'</strong>. The model remains 
unimpacted. In other words, <strong>D'</strong> still continues to exist recursively 
aggregated under <strong>A'</strong>. The synchronization does not propagate down the 
feature model aggregation hierarchy. </p>
<p>Further we call synchronization on attribute <strong>attr2</strong> of
<strong>B'. </strong>This synchronization now, results in the desired impact on 
our feature model. <strong>attr2</strong> of
<strong>B' </strong>only contains <strong>E'</strong>. Thus, it 
illustrates that synchronization must be explicitly called on feature attributes 
and one cannot rely on this synchronization propagating to all feature 
attributes down the aggregation hierarchy, recursively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An explanation of each of those steps follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="Create_doc"></a>Prolog</h3>
<p>The steps included inside the #ifdef V5 macro are for Session creation and 
Document creation. For detailed description on session creation and document 
creation you may see CAAObjectSpecsModeler.edu 
V5 UC documentation. It further creates the <strong>Credentials</strong> to authorize 
access to the features defined in the <strong>CAAOsmCatalogSU</strong> catalog. 
It next creates the StartUp facades (with credentials associated) and 
subsequently instantiates features, retrieved as 
feature facades in our code. </p>

<h3><a name="Synchronizing feat attr"></a>Synchronizing a Feature 
Attribute</h3>
<p>This is the only and most relevant step of this UC. It details the step 
involved to actually invoke the synchronization on a feature attribute. </p>
<pre class="code">...
<strong>CATFmAttributeName</strong> <strong>Attr1Name("Attr1")</strong>;
<strong>CATFmCredentials MyCredential</strong>;
...
<strong>CATFmFeatureFacade oFeatFacadeOnFeatAA (MyCredential)</strong>
...</pre>
<p>The feature under consideration is represented by a <em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em> 
type (oFeatFacadeOnFeatAA). We invoke synchronization on its attribute Attr1, in 
the next step. This attribute is represented by Attr1Name, a <em>
CATFmAttributeName</em> type.</p>
<pre class="code">...
rc = <strong>oFeatFacadeOnFeatAA.Synchronize(Attr1Name)</strong>;
...</pre>
<p>The call to synchronization simply involves invoking the Synchronize() 
function of the <em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em> class. It takes a single input 
namely. a <em>CATFmAttributeName</em> type (Attr1Name).&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
		<p>This Use Case illustrates the concept of synchronization of a feature 
		attribute. A feature is an instance of a StartUp or another feature. It 
		is characterized by attributes. Any modification of this attribute value 
		in the reference must essentially get reflected in the instances as 
		well, down the feature instantiation hierarchy, going by the 
		fundamentals of a Reference-Instance model. But this does not happen by 
		default. An explicit synchronization call must be invoked on a feature 
		attribute to realize its synchronization with its attribute value, in 
		the reference, up the instantiation hierarchy.</p>
<p>We fundamentally deal with a feature attribute of type <strong>component</strong> 
and <strong>component-list</strong>. Thus the synchronization actually involves 
an update of the features aggregated under feature instances, in sync with those 
aggregated under the feature reference.</p>
