<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Topology for Geometric Design</h2>
<p>Topology allows to represent objects, by detailing their boundaries and the connections 
between their different parts. This figure shows an example of the topological description 
of a simple shell object.</p>

<p>&quot;Regular&quot; objects are called manifold. Objects presenting &quot;hairs&quot; or &quot;scales&quot;, 
are called non-manifold. The use of non manifold topology is very useful to simplify 
the representation of objects: in an early stage of design, a thin stiffener of 
a solid object may be represented as a 2D element (&quot;scale&quot;).</p>

<h3><a name="Domain"></a>Domain</h3>
<p>A <em>domain</em> is a set of cells of dimension n connected by cells of dimension 
n-1. A domain can possibly contain only one cell.</p>
<p>Domains are useful to manipulate altogether the boundaries of a cell of upper 
dimension. If a face, for instance, is bounded by four connected edges, all those 
edges are conveniently grouped into a domain. Like cells, domains bear specific 
names according to what they actually contain.</p>

	</tr>
</table>
<p>Lumps, shells, wires and vertices in volume are boundaries of 3D entities. Loops 
and vertices in faces are boundaries of 2D entities. No domain is associated to 
the boundaries of edges (1D entities): vertices directly bounds edges, because such 
domain does not bring any added value to the model.</p>

			<li>A shell is a set of faces connected by edges bounding a volume.</li>
			<li>A wire is a set of edges connected by vertices in the 3D space.</li>
			<li>A vertex in face is immersed into the face. In the case of the figure, 
			it represents the connection between the face F and the cone C: this 
			is a non manifold configuration.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Domains can define outer, inner, or immersed frontiers: vertex in face or vertex 
in volume are typical immersed boundaries. Notice that loops (resp. shell) can also 
be immersed into a face (resp. volume), but this type of domain is always called 
a loop (resp. shell) and not a &quot;edge in face&quot; (resp. &quot;face in volume&quot;).</p>
<p>Reading the different definitions of the domains, you can see that two faces 
(resp. two volumes) cannot be connected only by a vertex (resp. by an edge or a 
vertex). In this case, it will be necessary to have two shells (resp. two lumps). 
Domains define manifold components inside non-manifold objects.</p>

<h3><a name="Body"></a>Body</h3>
<p>A <em>body</em> is a set of domains non necessarily connected (with non common 
boundary of any dimension). Bodies must satisfy the following properties: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Any cell bounding a cell in a body also belongs to the body.</li>
	<li>The intersection of the underlying geometry for any two cells in a body 
	is also the underlying geometry for a cell ( and this cell must belong to the 
	body, following the property 1). In other words, &quot;no intersection of the underlying 
	geometries without having a cell representing the intersection&quot;.</li>

<h2><a name="Manifold"></a>The Manifold and Non Manifold Concepts</h2>
<h3><a name="Definition"></a>Definition</h3>
<p>CGM allows you to create and use manifold and non-manifold bodies. Mathematically 
speaking, a N-manifold object is a set of points which neighborhood is represented 
by a N-dimensional bowl. Take a lump domain (resp. shell, loop). If for each point 
of this domain, there exists a neighborhood of the domain equivalent to <em>only 
one</em> piece of a sphere (resp. disk, segment), the lump (resp. shell, loop) is 
3D (resp. 2D, 1D ) -manifold. Otherwise, it is non manifold.</p>
<p>The following figures shows examples of manifold and non manifold objects. The 
place where there are non manifold are highlighted. The bodies can be: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Singular: if there exists cells of dimension n that are only connected by 
	cells of dimension n-2. (B4, B5, C4, C5).</li>
	<li>Heterogeneous: mixing of domains of different dimensions in the same body 
	(C6).</li>
	<li>General: cells of dimension n with more than 2 connections with other cells 
	of same dimension (A2, B6).</li>

<p>The non-manifold topology offers several benefits: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Allows the simplified representation of parts: a very slight slot inside 
	an object can be represented as a face immersed into a volume in an early stage 
	of design, a stiffener can be modeled as a face, etc.</li>
	<li>Allows topological operations to always return a solution. Even if the final 
	result is manifold, intermediate steps can be non manifold. A topological operation 
	on manifold bodies may return non-manifold configurations: let be a cube. Let 
	now be a cylinder which is tangent to the cube and inside it. These two objects 
	are manifold. Operate now the union of the cube and the cylinder: the resulting 
	body is non manifold. Split now by a plane: the final result is manifold, although 
	an intermediate body is not. This scenario is illustrated by the following figure:
	<table>

<h3><a name="Dividing"></a>Dividing a Body into Domains</h3>
<p>When a body contains non connected cells, or non-manifold configurations, it 
will be necessary to divide it into several manifold domains. The following steps 
insure the unique decomposition of a body into domains: </p>
<ol>
	<li>If there are non connected sets of cells, put them in different domains.</li>
	<li>Separate domains of different dimensions.

<h2><a name="Restrictions"></a>Restrictions Regarding Non-Manifold Bodies</h2>
<p>Most operations can be performed on non-manifold bodies, but not all. The trend 
is to allow the user to check whether he accepts to generate a non-manifold result. 
For example, you won&#39;t be able to extrude or fill a profile which has a closed portion 
but exhibits a free edge and unless you uncheck the &quot;Manifold&quot; check box, you won&#39;t 
be able to join a non-manifold body to another body.</p>
<p>If you try to manipulate non-manifold bodies by using a CATIA interactive command, 
you will get a message warning you that the body is non-manifold. Usually, you won&#39;t 
be able to complete the intended operation unless you make your initial body manifold. 
CATIA dialogs allow you to remove sub-elements in order to obtain appropriate manifold 
bodies. But the operation which consists in removing sub-elements can only be applied 
to manifold domains. If your body is not made up of correct manifold domains, you 
won&#39;t be able to clean or transform your initial body. This is why
<a href="#Dividing">&quot;Dividing a Body into Domains&quot;</a> is of importance. </p>
<p>Note that CGM services allow you to create non-manifold bodies while usually 
the CATIA workbenches will &quot;break&quot; the created bodies into appropriate domains. 
That way, the resulting bodies are non-manifold-like but contain sub-elements easy 
to be manipulated. The examples below illustrate this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Example 1: Using a NON-MANIFOLD Body in a Join Operation</em></strong></p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Create a three-edge body (see figure on the right-hand side) by assembling 
		three concurrent wires (use CATTopWire then CATHybAssemble). This body is 
		made up of <strong>four vertices and three edges</strong>. It is clearly 
		non-manifold. You can check this by using the CATBody::GetCellsHighestDimension 
		method.<p>If you try to join the highlighted body (a line) with the three-edge 
		body by using the Join interactive command, you will get the message:</p>
		<p>&quot;Update error: Non Manifold Body&quot;.</p>
		</td>
		<td>
		<img alt="Non-manifold Body" src="images/CAACgmTobnonManifp.jpg" width="285" height="191"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Now, if you try to remove the edge that makes the resulting body non-manifold 
		(use the &quot;Sub-Elements to Remove&quot; tab in the &quot;Join Definition&quot; dialog box), 
		you will get the message:
		<p>&quot;Bad topology&quot;.</p>
		<p>This message tells you that the sub-element to be deleted is not <em>
		<strong>fully</strong></em> contained into a domain. Actually, it shares 
		a vertex with two other wires. You cannot go further in your operation, 
		you must rebuild the initial body to make it manifold or divide it into 
		manifold domains as indicated <a href="#Dividing">above</a>. In this case, 
		the best would consist in dividing the body into three single-edge wires 
		not sharing any vertices. </p>
		</td>

		up of three wires and six vertices, if you try to join the highlighted body 
		(a line) with the three-edge body, you will get also the message:

		<p>But now, if you try to remove the edge that makes the resulting body 
		non-manifold (use the &quot;Sub-Elements to Remove&quot; tab in the &quot;Join Definition&quot; 
		dialog box), CATIA will remove it and the join operation will complete.</p>
