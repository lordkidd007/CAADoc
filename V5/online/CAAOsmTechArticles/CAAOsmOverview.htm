<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>The Characteristics of the Feature
Modeler</h3>
<p>The feature modeler has three main characteristics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is a <b>high-level object-oriented modeler</b> in the sense
that it allows the creation and management of simple or complex data
objects</li>
  <li>It is a <b>prototype/instance modeler</b> because an instance
can be modified so that it itself serves as a prototype for the
creation of yet other instances.</li>
  <li>It is a <b>spec/result modeler</b> in that it allows the
creation of a network of inter-related data objects in order to be able
to automatically update the "result" of an object whose "spec" has been
modified</li>
</ol>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="HighLevelOO"></a>A High-Level Object-Oriented Data Modeler</h4>
<p>Types of attributes.</p>
<p>A feature object can be partially described by its attributes.
Attributes are like "slots" attached to feature objects in which data
is stored. Attributes contain two main types of data:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Simple data which is composed of single values of C++ types such
as integer, double, string, etc.</li>
  <li>Feature data which is composed of a feature object which in turn
has attributes that can be simple or feature types of data.</li>
</ol>
<p>An attribute is essentially defined by its:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name: this name must be unique to the feature object to which the
attribute is attached. In other words, the same name cannot be given to
another attribute of the same feature object.</li>
  <li>Type: this is the kind of data the attribute can contain (i.e.,
simple data of type integer, double, etc., or feature data).</li>
  <li>Quality: this is a keyword (sp_IN, sp_OUT or sp_NEUTRAL) used in
the generation of consistent data values during an update operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at a simple example. Say that we want to define a feature
called "Point2D" which would represent a 2-D Point. This feature would
have to reference at least the attributes containing the coordinates of
a point. The feature object "Point2D.1" could look like this:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmAttrPoint1.gif" border="0" height="142" width="165"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the attributes "H" and "V" contain simple double-type
values.</p>
<p>Let's define a second feature object, "Point2D.2":</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmAttrPoint2.gif" border="0" height="135" width="156"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that "Point2D.1" and "Point2D.2" have the same data structure:
they are instances of the same feature type, "Point2D".</p>
<p>Now, we can define another feature object representing a line
segment based on the two points defined above. "Line2D.1" would look
like this:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><img src="images/CAAOsmAttrLine.gif" border="0" height="189" width="155"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the "StartPoint" amd "EndPoint" attributes are
feature-type attributes referencing "Point2D.1" and "Point2D.2".</p>
<p>Feature attributes are of two types:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>SpecObject</b> or <b>Referenced</b>. The feature can be
referenced as an attribute by any number of other feature objects. It
exists independently of the feature object to which it is attached.</li>
  <li><b>Component</b> or <b>Aggregated</b>. The feature can be
aggregated by only one feature object to which it <b>belongs</b>
henceforward. The aggregating feature object is said to be the <b>parent</b>
of the aggregated feature object, called the <b>child</b>. If ever the
parent is deleted, the child is also deleted. Once it has been
aggregated, the existence of a child feature object is directly related
to the existence of its parent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a complete schematic view of the different types of
attributes:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmAttrType.gif" border="0" height="201" width="396"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that new attributes can be added to an existing feature object
and that existing attribute values can be modified, thus allowing a
feature object to be enriched dynamically at run-time.</p>
<p>An integrated modeler.</p>
<p>One major benefit of the data modeler aspect of the feature modeler
is that it provides a set of generic mechanisms that are natively
integrated to the V5 environment. In other words, each feature object
created is treated as a native V5 object, thus benefiting from
elaborate services existing automatically, which provide for the
following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transactions: allowing the "Undo" of modifications applied to a
feature object</li>
  <li>Cut, copy and paste feature objects</li>
  <li>Persistency: save and retrieve (stream/unstream) a feature object
within the container of the document in which it exists</li>
  <li>Link Management: referencing any feature object a stable way</li>
  <li>Introspection: list the attributes of a feature object</li>
  <li>Navigation: position a feature object in a feature inheritance
tree.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h4><a name="PrototypeInstance"></a>A Prototype/Instance Object Model</h4>
<h5><a name="Prototypes"></a>About Prototypes</h5>
<p>A feature prototype is a feature object. Any feature object is a
potential prototype since it can be instantiated in order to create a
new feature object. The initial feature prototype is called a <b>StartUp</b>
and it is stored in a catalog to be accessed and re-used by any number
of applications. It describes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A data structure through its <b>attributes</b></li>
  <li>The <b>behavior</b> that can be performed on its data through
its <b> type</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A StartUp may also have a <b>supertype. </b>In this case, it is
said to "derive" from the StartUp having the supertype as its type.
This means that it inherits not only the data structure of the deriving
StartUp, i.e., its attributes, but any specific behavior it may have
been given as well. Feature behavior is the set of operations that can
be applied to a feature. These operations are, for example, the methods
by which you can calculate values assigned to attributes.</p>
<p>Behind a feature late type, there are certain interface
implementations specific to a given feature. In the previous example of
the "Line2D" feature type, we saw that one of the operations needed to
be applied to a line is to draw it: We would logically, therefore, have
to define an interface containing a method by which the line can be
drawn. Let's see what a complete prototype of the "Line2D" feature
could look like:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmLineProto.gif" border="0" height="225" width="345"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Every feature of type "Line2D" instantiated from this prototype
would inherit these same attributes and behaviors.</p>
<p>When a feature has been assigned a supertype, it can be manipulated
by using the interfaces implemented both by its type <b>and</b> by its
supertype. Here is another example of the "Pad" feature:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmSuperType.gif" border="0" height="134" width="153"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The "Pad" feature prototype has "Pad" as its type and "Prism" as its
supertype. The "Prism" feature prototype has "Prism" as its type and
"MechanicalFormFeature" as its supertype. You can manipulate a "Prism"-
type feature with the interfaces implemented by both the types "Prism"
and "MechanicalFormFeature". When you create a feature and specify a
supertype for it, you are in effect extending both its behavior and its
data. You extend the feature behavior as the feature receives an
additional set of operations from the feature with the supertype as its
type. You extend the data as the feature receives the attributes from
the feature with the supertype as its type. In other words, you are <b>deriving</b>
a new type of feature from an existing one.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmSuperType2.gif" border="0" height="260" width="193"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>In the above example, the feature "Prism" is defined by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>its type: "Prism"</li>
  <li>its supertype: "MechanicalFormFeature"</li>
  <li>its attributes: "Sketch", "Direction", "EndLimit", "StartLimit".</li>
</ul>
<p>Having "Prism" as its supertype, "Pad", therefore, inherits the
behaviors and attributes defined for the "MechanicalFormFeature" as
well as the behavior and attributes defined for the "Prism".</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Instances"></a>About Instances</h5>
<p>A StartUp is retrieved from the catalog at run-time and it is
instantiated in order to create a new feature object. When this
happens, the StartUp is called the "reference" and the new feature
object created is called the "instance". This new object inherits both
the data structure, i.e., the attributes assigned to the StartUp, as
well as the behavior attributed to it, i.e., the interfaces implemented
for this feature type. You can see, then, how useful prototypes can be
because they can be re-used, i.e., retrieved any number of times in
order to create new feature objects from them.</p>
<p>An "instance", however, can also become a "reference" when it itself
is instantiated to create another new feature object. In this case, the
new "instance" created also inherits the actual values stored in the
attribute "slots". The instance itself can be a reference. Actually,
all feature objects are instances originally since all features are
created by instantiation.</p>
<p>An instance is said to be strongly tied to its reference if few
attributes of the reference have been overridden. It is said to be
lightly tied to its reference if many attributes of the reference have
been overridden.</p>
<p>When an instance is created from its reference, by default, the
reference attributes are repeated in the instance. You can add new
attributes to an instance and you can modify the value of an inherited
attribute as well. When an attribute value is modified somewhere in the
chain of the features depending on it, the modification is propagated
to the objects downstream from the modified feature. However, at the
same time, the modified feature has become distinct from its references
upstream.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmPointInstRef.gif" border="0" height="305" width="520"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Above is an example of instantiation: Two new Point2D features,
Point2D.1 and Point2D.2 are created. The first, Point2D.1, by
instantiating the StartUp Point2D, the second by instantiating
Point2D.1. Point2D.1 thus is both the instance of the Point2D reference
and the reference of the Point2D.2 instance. If the attribute "H" were
modified in Point2D.1, the change would be propagated to Point2D.2:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmPointInstRef_1.gif" border="0" height="306" width="523"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>At the same time, Point2D.1 would become separate from its
reference, Point2D, and any changes in the "H" attribute of Point2D
would not be propagated to Point2D.1. However, if the initial value of
V in Point2D were modified, this change would be propagated to
Point2D.1 and Point2D.2.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmPointInstRef_2.gif" border="0" height="294" width="523"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the Prototype/Instance Model allows for data
extension through the instantiation mechanism (reference -&gt;
instance) and for behavior extension through the derivation of
StartUps. In summary, it has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Prototype/Instance Model is based on the ability to find good
enough instances (prototypes) and to make variations from them.</li>
  <li>Instances are created by cloning a prototype. A modified instance
can be a prototype in turn leading to generations of instances.</li>
  <li>The Prototype/Instance Model is very good for making incremental
design variations starting from a validated instance. It allows for
automatic change propagation across generations of instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a schematic view of the prototype/instance mechanism:</p>
<table width="100%">

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="SpecResult"></a>A Spec/Result Modeler</h4>
<p>"Specs" are what make up an object, its definition. What happens
after the "specs" have been processed is called the "Result". For
example, in the case of a line segment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two points are the "specs" of the segment.</li>
  <li>The line segment is the "result" of its "specs".</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, each point is specified by a set of coordinates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The set of coordinates are the "specs" of the point.</li>
  <li>The point is the "result" of its "specs".</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spec/Result Modeler provides an infrastructure for spec/result
management, also called the Build/Update mechanism.</p>
<p>Now, if ever any one of the coordinates of any one of the points
were modified, the line segment would have to be redrawn as well. In
other words, whenever the "specs" change, the "result" must be updated.
As you can see, all of the results must be updated in order for the
model to remain coherent. The Build/Update mechanism allows precisely
for this to happen: Because of the inter-relations defined between
specs, when one spec is modified, it automatically triggers the update
of all of the specs dependent on it.</p>
<p>The Build/Update mechanism has two basic activities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Calculating each spec in order to update results. Whenever a spec
input is no longer valid, a network of inter-related specs undertakes
to re-calculate every dependent spec in turn in order to obtain an
updated result.</li>
  <li>Defining the relationships between specs. The features defining
these specs have a formal definition of their input/output attributes.
They cooperate by forming a network in which the feature specs must
produce a result given the valuated input values of the attributes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a general view of the update function of the Build/Update
mechanism:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmGeneralBU.gif" border="0" height="415" width="777"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The main benefits of the Spec/Result Modeler are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homogeneity of data between applications as the update of data is
propagated throughout a system</li>
  <li>Company rules and know-how are captured more effectively. For
example, two pieces of information such as the weight and the thickness
of a given object can be considered as two inter-related specs. When
one is modified, it triggers the other to be re-calculated, thus always
maintaining a coherent result.</li>
  <li>A result is explainable given the specs</li>
  <li>Designers do design, not clerical tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Names_of_Features"></a>Names of Features</h4>
<p align="left">For any StartUp or feature there are two kinds of names
to consider, the <a href="#Internal_Name">internal name</a> and the <a
 href="#External_Name">external name</a>. The first is named
"internal" because it is hidden for the end user. The "external" name
is, on the other hand, seen through user interfaces, like the
specification tree, and it is used for some user mechanisms such as the
Search.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="Internal_Name"></a>Internal Name</b></p>
<p align="left">For a StartUp, the internal name is its late type. When
creating a StartUp, it is declared using the CATfctEditorAssistant tool. Refer to the Other Entities section of the "CAA V5 C++ Naming
Rules" article [<a href="#References">6</a>] for the StartUp (late
type) naming rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is not possible to change afterwards the
internal name of a feature which is returned by the <code>GetName</code>
of <i>CATISpecObject.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="External_Name"></a>External Name</b></p>
<p align="left">It is the name seen by the end user and which can be
translated (NLS). With the difference of the internal name, it can be
modified. The <i>CATIAlias</i> interface manages this name whith two
methods whose specifications are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><code>SetAlias: </code>Change the external name
using the name entered by the end user, and ensure its
persistency.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><code>GetAlias:</code> Return the name set by <code>
SetAlias</code> or, if the name is empty, return a default name.
According to the <i>CATIAlias</i> implementation, the default name
computing can vary. It is detailed&nbsp; just below, in the <a
 href="#CATIAlias_Implementation">CATIAlias Implementation</a>
section. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b><a name="CATIAlias_Implementation"></a>CATIAlias
Implementation</b></p>
<p align="left">This interface manages the external name of a feature.
This section explains the different Dassault Systemes (DS)
implementations, and what do you need to do when you create your own
feature.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The default implementation </p>
    <p><i>CATIAlias</i> interface is implemented on any feature as
follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><code>SetAlias </code>modifies the external
name from the end user input, BUT does not ensure the
persistency.&nbsp; </p>
      </li>
      <li> <align ="left"><code>GetAlias</code> returns the name set
by <code> SetAlias</code> or if any, the <a
 href="#Default_External_Name">default external name</a>.&nbsp;</align></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The implementation on Dassault Systemes
features&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The <i>CATIAlias</i> interface is re-implemented on the
Dassault Systemes features to ensure the name persistency, otherwise
the <align ="left"><code>GetAlias</code> method is such as the default
implementation described just above.</align> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, if your feature has no <i>CATIAlias</i>
re-implementation in its inheritance to ensure the name persistency,
the <i>CATIAlias</i> re-implementation is mandatory. On the other
hand, if your feature derives from a DS feature, the re-implementation
is not necessary, except for specific cases. The article entitled
"Integrating New Features in CATIA" [<a href="#References">7</a>]
explains how to re-implement <i>CATIAlias</i> and gives some
recommendations.</p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="Default_External_Name"></a>Default External
Name</b></p>
<p align="left">For a StartUp, the default name is a name set in the
CATNls file associated with the StartUp catalog - See the <a
 href="#Naming_a_StartUp">Naming StartUp</a> section for
implementation details. It is the recommended methodology. But if this
Nls file is not provided, the internal name of
the StartUp is used as default.</p>
<p align="left">For a feature, its default name is the default name of
its StartUp to which an index value can be appended, like for its <a
 href="#Internal_Name">internal name</a>. See the <a
 href="#Feature_Indexation">Feature Indexation</a><b> </b>section
for details.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">For both, the <code>GetDisplayName</code> method
of&nbsp; <i> CATISpecObject</i> interface returns the "default"
external name of the feature. </p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="Feature_Indexation"></a>Feature Indexation</b></p>
<p align="left">As explained here-above, all instances of the same StartUp will have the same name (the <a href="#Default_External_Name">default external name</a>). 
It is often desirable to identify each instance with a unique name. 
This is achieved thanks to a mechanism known as <a href="#Feature_Indexation"> Feature indexation</a>, 
that adds an unique numerical suffix to the usual name: 
in a CATPart document, instances of the <tt>"Sketch"</tt> StartUp will be labeled <tt>"Sketch<b>.1</b>"</tt>, <tt>"Sketch<b>.2</b>"</tt> and so on.</p> 
 
<p align="left">Names unicity directly depends on the suffix unicity. The numbers used as suffixes are granted by different 
sources that maintain a counter for each type of object requesting an index: the first <tt>"Line"</tt> will be <tt>"Line<b>.1</b>"</tt> 
and the first <tt>"Point"</tt> will be <tt>"Point<b>.1</b>"</tt>. For each request the counter related to the requesting object type will be

as context).</p> 
 
<ol><li><a name="Default_Behavior"></a><p align="left">Default behavior.<br/> 
<a href="#Feature_Indexation"> Feature indexation</a> gets activated by default on a feature instance when this feature gets aggregated. 
In such a case the aggregating object (or "owner", or "father") will issue the new number to its component, 
making it's name unique among all the aggregating object components. This leads to a relative unicity: you 
cannot have two <tt>"Line<b>.1</b>"</tt> objects in the same Sketch object but a <tt>"Part/Sketch<b>.1</b>/Line<b>.1</b>"</tt> and a <tt>"Part/Sketch<b>.2</b>/Line<b>.1</b>"</tt> 
could exist in the same document. If this is not desirable see <a href="#Customization">Customization</a> section here-under. 
If the aggregation relation is suppressed (thanks to a call like <code>CATISpecObject::RemoveComponent</code>), the (ex)component 
will lose its suffix and its name will revert to the <a href="#Default_External_Name">default external name</a>. If aggregated again, the instance 
will get a new index from its new owner as if it had never been aggregated.</p>
	</li> 
<li><a name="Customization"></a><p align="left">Customized behavior.<br /> 
Indexation can also be used on root instances (i.e. instances that are not intended to be aggregated) via the 
<code>CATISpecObject::SetAutoNameFather</code> method. This will associate the instance and a numbering source as if the 
instance had been aggregated (hence the <code>SetAutoNameFather method</code> name). This operation is not reversible, 
and the index will not be changed if the instance gets aggregated. Only another call to <code>SetAutoNameFather</code> 
will alter the name if the index source is changed. The name will never revert to the <a href="#Default_External_Name">default external name</a>. 
This can be used to get a document wide name unicity by using the same context for all instances.</p>
<p align="left">If you plan to agregate features but still use a document-wide numbering, it is recommended to call 
the <code>SetAutoName</code> method before calling the <code>CATISpecObject::SetSpecObject</code> method or <code>CATIDescendant</code> interface 
to avoid wasting numbers and CPU cycles.</p></li></ol>
 
<p align="left"><u>Limitations.</u> 
<ul><li>This mechanism was designed as a default, lightweight solution and implemented in order to add as little 
overhead (CPU time, data size) as possible. Consequently a new number is issued every time, no matter whether 
a lower number issued previously could be reused or not (indexes are not "recycled"). 
Even if you create and immediatly delete <tt>"Point<b>.1</b>"</tt>, the next point will be labeled <tt>"Point<b>.2</b>"</tt>.<br/> 
Note: undoing the creation of <tt>"Point<b>.1</b>"</tt> is not equivalent to deleting it, indexes granted during an 
undone transaction are considered as if they had never been issued.</li> 
<li>Mixing the <a href="#Default_Behavior">Default</a> and <a href="#Customization">Customized</a> behaviors can lead to an inconsistent numbering scheme with duplicate names.</li> 
<li>It is not recommended to use the <code>CATISpecObject::SetAutoNameFather</code> call cross container boundaries as it 
can lead to the same issues.</li> 
<li><code>CATISpecObject::SetAutoNameFather</code> MUST NOT be used to set a naming context that is not in the same document as the feature instance.</li></ul></p>

<p>Read the OSM language article instead [<a href="#References">8</a>] . </p>
<p>A StartUp is a feature prototype. It describes the preliminary data
structure of a feature. To be meaningful, a StartUp definition should
possess attributes. Attributes are the actual "slots" where feature
data will be stored.</p>
<p>StartUps must be created in catalogs. A StartUp catalog is a special
type of document which must be loaded into a session before any StartUp
can be created or accessed. Creating StartUps in catalogs assures their
persistency. It also allows existing StartUps to be shared by other
applications.</p>
<p>The StartUp catalog file is a .<b>CATfct</b> file located in the
CNext\resources\graphic directory of your framework.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Accessing_StartUps">Accessing StartUps from Catalogs</a></h5>
<p>To create a new catalog, use the CATfctEditorAssistant tool/ OSM language [<a href="#References">9</a>].</p>
<p>Once features have been instantiated in a document, the catalog
defining their StartUps cannot be re-created. You should only use the CATfctEditorAssistant tool/ OSM language to modify the StartUp catalog. With this 
the Startups are
in ReadWrite access mode in the catalog.<br>
Once your catalog is ready for production usage you should distribute
it in ReadOnly mode (i.e. conversion of .osm file to .CATfct file using 
CATfctEditor Assistant tool) to avoid unwanted changes and its presence in the
CATIA
V5 "Save Management" command. </p>
<p>The <span class="style1">CATOsmSUHandler</span> is a class which gives you 
handle on the StartUps and enables you to retrieve the StartUp, it is sufficient to carry out
instantiations, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The class to manage a StartUp in catalog is
(CATOsmSUHandler). This class enables you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To retrieve a StartUp with the <code>RetrieveSU</code> method.</li>
  <li>To Instanciate a StartUp with the <span class="style1">Instanciate()</span>
method.</li>

<h5><a name="CreatingStartUps"></a>Creating a StartUp</h5>
<p>Before studying in details the methods to create a StartUp, consider
the various cases which can arise at you. For each case, there is an
appropriate method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You create a StartUp from "scratch" ( no super type)&nbsp;</li>
  <p>You have no dependency with another StartUp and consequently you
have no need to load before an StartUp catalog.</p>
  <li>You create a StartUp deriving from an another one&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>For the above cases you will have to use the CATfctEditorAssistant tool which will allow you to declare startUps in the .osm files and then instanciate them in some applicative container</p>

<h5><a name="AddingAttributes"></a>Adding Attributes to StartUps</h5>
<p>In order to define the data structure of a new StartUp, it is
necessary to describe its attributes. These attributes can be added to a 
StartUps using the OSM language. First we have to convert the .CATfct file to a 
ReadWrite mode which is .osm file. In this osm file you can directly add your 
attributes to desired StartUp. Here you can also initialize the attributes.<br>
Refer to the following article [<a href="#References">8</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attribute type describes the type of value the attribute can
contain. Here is a complete list of the <b>types of attributes</b>
that can be defined:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><b>Type</b>:</td>
      <td width="50%"><b>Specifies</b>:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_string</code></td>
      <td width="50%">C++ char * type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_double</code></td>
      <td width="50%">C++ double type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_boolean</code></td>
      <td width="50%">CATBoolean type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_octet</code></td>
      <td width="50%">C++ unsigned char type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_integer</code></td>
      <td width="50%">C++ integer type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_specobject</code></td>
      <td width="50%">"referenced" feature attribute</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_component</code></td>
      <td width="50%">"aggregated" feature attribute</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_external</code></td>
      <td width="50%">symbolic link to another feature object</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><code>tk_list</code></td>
      <td width="50%">list of any other type</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>An attribute can have a given type and <code>tk_list</code> at the
same time. For example, it can be a <code>tk_string</code> and a <code>tk_list</code>,
meaning that it contains a list of string-type data.</p>
<p>The <code>tk_specobject</code> and <code>tk_component</code>
attribute types define particular feature attributes. In other words,
the attribute data will contain a pointer to another existing feature.
The difference between attributes of type <code>tk_specobject</code>
and those of type <code> tk_component</code> is that in the former
case, the feature data structure pointed to by the attribute is said to
be "referenced" by it and in the latter case, it is said to be
"aggregated" to it. A "referenced feature" can be referenced by any
number of other features. It exists independently of any of them. On
the contrary, an "aggregated feature" belongs to the feature that
aggregates it. It cannot belong to any other feature and its existence
is tied to this "parent" feature.</p>
<p>Here is a schematic view of attribute types and their possible
type-definitions:</p>

<h3><a name="BuildUpdate"></a>The Build/Update Mechanism of the
Specs/Result Modeler</h3>
<p>The objective of the Specs/Result Modeler is to offer a general
model for the definition and management of specs and results, to be
able to particularize this model, and to manage common mechanisms
automatically. The Build/Update Mechanism is the means of reaching this
objective. </p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="BuildingFeatures"></a>Building a Feature</h4>
<p>As you have seen in the previous sections, a feature is an object to
which attributes are assigned. These attributes are usually related to
each other. The values of certain attributes result from an operation
taking as its input parameters the values of other attributes.</p>
<p>For a given feature, the Build operation consists in defining how
certain attributes depend on others and how to recalculate the value of
attributes so that all the attributes of a feature have consistent
values.</p>
<p>A Build operation may use as its parameters values originating from
other features. Suppose you have just performed a Build operation on a
feature and somewhere among all the features and feature attributes
upstream, something is modified. This may have an impact on your
feature. Your feature may require a parameter which is a value
resulting from another feature which itself uses as a parameter an
attribute just modified. In such a case, your first feature is in an
inconsistent state. To make your feature consistent, you should
normally detect what has been modified upstream from your feature, then
rebuild one by one all the features that need to be rebuilt upstream up
to your first feature, i.e., the one you want to make consistent. This
would be quite a chore and a risky one as you will never be able to
guarantee that you have not missed something. To avoid this problem,
the feature platform provides you with an algorithm which, when applied
to a given feature, detects and rebuilds what is necessary to make the
feature consistent.</p>
<p>Every time this mechanism is applied to a feature, all the features
upstream from the updated feature are rebuilt if needed, i.e., if they
are found to be out of date by the mechanism.</p>
<p>This default algorithm is based on the <code>sp_IN</code> and <code>sp_OUT</code>
qualities of the attributes which are analyzed by the Update operation.
The attribute quality is passed as the last argument of the <i>CATISpecObject</i><code>::AddAttribute</code>
method when the attribute is initially defined. The possible values are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>sp_IN</code></li>
  <li><code>sp_OUT</code></li>
  <li><code>sp_NEUTRAL</code></li>
</ul>
<p>How you choose the quality of an attribute depends on how you want
each attribute and feature of your application to be updated when one
of the objects potentially impacting other objects of your feature
network is modified. The default Update algorithm operates according to
the attribute qualities. If you use this default Update mechanism, the
trick is then to specify the appropriate qualities for attributes.</p>
<p>Attributes defined with <code>sp_IN</code> are those which are
usually required to define or specify a feature. If one of these values
is modified, you wish to rebuild your feature when it is applied the
Update command. These attributes are all recognized by the default
Update operation. When the default Update operation is applied to a
feature, the Build/Update mechanism automatically scans all the <code>sp_IN</code>
attributes of all the features potentially impacting the feature to be
updated to detect whether any of these attributes has been modified.</p>
<p>Attributes defined with <code>sp_OUT</code> are those whose values
result from a Build operation and may be used as input parameters for
other features. The Update algorithm needs to determine whether these
attributes are up-to-date and if they are not, how they can be updated.
Specifying an attribute as <code>sp_OUT</code> means that the
attribute is not up-to-date if its owner feature is not up-to-date. In
order to update the <code>sp_OUT</code> attribute, you must first
update its owning feature.</p>
<p>Attributes defined with <code>sp_NEUTRAL</code> are ignored by the
default Update operation.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="UpdatingFeatures"></a>Updating a System of Features</h4>
<p>Let's again take the example of the line segment defined by two
points. For each point, a <code>Build</code> operation is defined in
order to re-draw the point using the modified value of one or more of
its coordinates. Whenever a modification occurs, an <code>Update</code>
operation on the Line is performed, triggering the <code>Build</code>
operation to be executed on the Point whose value has changed. A Line
will also have a Build operation associated with it so that it can be
re-drawn whenever one of its values has changed. Here is the order in
which the Update of the line will occur:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/CAAOsmLineBU.gif" border="0" height="227" width="393"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, in order for the "Build Point2D.1" operation to occur, the
keyword sp_IN must have been added to the attribute "StartPoint" of the
"Line2D" feature. This means that this value must be valid before the
building of the line can occur. So, the building of "Point2D.1" is
performed, unless it is known to be valid already. The same goes for
the attribute "EndPoint" and for "Point2D.2". The "H" and "V"
attributes of the "Point2D" feature, however, must be declared as sp_IN.</p>
<p>The specific Build operation is defined by implementing the <i>CATIBuild</i>
interface. The default Build operation is empty. There is, however, a
default Update operation, triggered by the execution of the <code>Update</code>
method of <i>CATISpecObject</i>.</p>
<p>See the CAAOsmBuildUpdate use case [<a href="#References">9</a>] for
a complete programming example of the Build/Update Mechanism.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>The Feature Modeler is a high-level object-oriented data modeler, a
prototype/instance object modeler and a spec/result modeler.</p>
<p>The basic tasks required when working with features deal with
creating StartUps in catalogs and with modeling actual feature objects.
New catalogs can be created or existing catalogs can be loaded into the
current session. Once a catalog exists in the session, working with
StartUps consists in creating them, accessing them, or adding new
attributes to them. New feature objects are created in a document by
the instantiation of an existing StartUp or of another feature object.
Working with a feature object consists in valuating its attributes,
retrieving its attributes and deleting the feature object itself.</p>
<p>The Build/Update Mechanism consists in defining <code>Build</code>
operations for specific features that are implicated in an
inter-related system of specs and results. The execution of an <code>Update</code>
operation triggers the different <code>Build</code> operations to be
performed in order for the system to yield coherent results.</p>
