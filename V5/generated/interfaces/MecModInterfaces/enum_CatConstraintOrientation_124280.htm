<h1>CatConstraintOrientation <font size=-1>(Enumeration)</font></h1>
<pre>
enum <b>CatConstraintOrientation</b> {
  catCstOrientSame,
  catCstOrientOpposite,
  catCstOrientUndefined
}
</pre>
<b><i> Constraint elements relative orientation.</i></b><br>

 <br>
 When two geometrical elements are constrained, there is often a variety 
 of relative positions and orientations of these elements that respect 
 the constraint. For instance,   
 if a distance constraint is placed on two planes, 
 the second plane can lie on both sides of first plane while maintaining
 the requested distance: the constraint is respected, but 
 geometry remains unresolved. Furthermore, even if the side is fixed,
 second plane still can be oriented so that its normal points towards the
 first plane or in the opposite direction, without breaking the constraint.
 <br>
 Managing such indetermination requires control over two variables:
 <dl>
 <dt><b>Side</b>
   <dd>determines, when relevant, on which side of each other constrained
       elements should be positionned
 <dt><b>Orientation</b>
   <dd>determines, when relevant, how to orient constrained elements,  
       whith respect to each other.  
 </dl>
 
 This enum deals with possibles options for dealing with the 
 <b>Orientation</b> variable (see <a href="../MecModInterfaces/enum_CatConstraintSide_61126.htm">CatConstraintSide</a> for possibles options for <b>Side</b>).  
 <p>
 This enum is based on the notion of characteristic vector. A
 characteristic vector is a vector which is associated with a constrained
 element each time it can be assimilated to a line or a plane. The vector
 represents the direction of the line, or the direction normal to the 
 plane. 
  
 
<dl>
  <dt> <b>Values:</b>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt> catCstOrientSame</tt>
   <dd>   specifies that characteristic vectors associated to  constrained 
   elements have same orientation.
   
 </dd>
    <dt><tt> catCstOrientOpposite</tt>
   <dd>   specifies that characteristic vectors associated to constrained 
   elements have opposite orientation.  
 
 </dd>
    <dt><tt> catCstOrientUndefined</tt>
   <dd>   specifies that the relative orientation of characteristic vectors 
   associated to constrained elements is not specified</dd>
</dl>
