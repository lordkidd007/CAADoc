		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>V5 offers a wide access to the V5 data model through a large set of C++ 
		classes, interfaces, and global functions. Many mechanisms allow you to 
		extend and customize V5 data to make it your data and to fit it with the 
		behavior you expect, such as the V5 Object Model, the V5 Feature Model, 
		and the User Features with CATIA and DELMIA in the authoring scope. With 
		ENOVIA, the data customization and the user exit interfaces enable you to 
		model data and processes to match you own business rules. </p>
		<p>V6 adds many new strong characteristics, such as an unbreakable data 
		server, a unified product model, and PLM identification and semantic relations. 
		V6 lets you take advantage of them while providing a more robust development 
		platform.</p>

<h2><a name="New"></a>What Is New with V6?</h2>
<p>V6 reflects the changes brought to V6 compared to V5.</p>
<p>The main change in the data model consists in replacing the document-centric 
model relying on files with a product/representation model relying on a database. 
Main characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The V5 document-centric model relying on files does not exist any longer. 
	There are no Part, Product, Drawing, Material, or Analysis documents and files 
	any longer. They are replaced with products and representations.</li>
	<li>All data models are specializations of the same PLM Core model that enables 
	a non-semantic server-layer code to perform robust query and save operations 
	on stateless servers, preventing from data mapping problems and data loss.</li>
	<li>The Product model, as well as the other data models, is a unique entity-relation 
	based model designed to reduce the storage size in the database, to allow for 
	large assemblies in sessions and for perfect symmetry without data loss when 
	back and forth loading and storing data.</li>
	<li>Parts support the multi-representation thanks to isolation between the part 
	reference and its shape</li>
	<li>The relations enabling the relational design are now semantic relations, 
	that is, relations with a meaning that not only the application that sets the 
	relation can understand, removing implicit behavior. These semantic relations 
	are declarative and stored in the database and thus can be accessed as any other 
	database stored entity.</li>
	<li>Each PLM entity is assigned a unique identifier whatever its type supporting 
	any PLM operations, such as versioning, configuration, or replication. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes are related to the user interface that offers a PLM toolbar and 
a PLM compass in addition to the 3D compass, for easy search, navigation, and real-time 
collaboration.</p>

<h2><a name="Bring"></a>What Does V6 Bring?</h2>
<p>V6 brings your applications a new and more robust way to create, store, and navigate 
V5 native data and to model your own data. Each piece of data is stored in the database 
and can be accessed using generic queries. Each relation between two pieces of data 
is seen in the database and can be used by authoring applications, but also by non 
authoring applications thanks to the semantic relation concept.</p>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h2><a name="Change"></a>What Has Changed with V6?</h2>
<p>The changes with V6 deal with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Software architecture</li>
	<li>Data model</li>
</ul>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3>Software Architecture Changes</h3>
<p>V6 benefits from a full software architecture review to enable for less framework 
and application couplings for better code modularity:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frameworks prerequisites rules have been enhanced to allow a better control 
	of applications architecture and ease management of architecture modifications 
	to client applications. This is described in <em>Framework architecture rules</em> 
	[<a href="#References">2</a>] and <em>The IdentityCard.h special file</em> [<a href="#References">14</a>].</li>
	<li>Some key frameworks are reengineered to achieve this goal, even if the APIs 
	themselves are not changed, requiring replacements in IdentityCard.h and Imakefile.mk 
	files only.<br />
	This is described in <em>V6 Adoption Methodology</em> [<a href="#References">1</a>].</li>
	<li>Some new concepts regarding frameworks isolation and prerequisite controls 
	are implemented, leading also to check for headers content consistency and complete 
	IdentityCard files.<br />
	This is described in <em>V6 Framework Architecture</em> [<a href="#References">2</a>].</li>
	<li>The Geometric Modeler frameworks are reengineered to ensure minimum code 
	size at installation and to load code when necessary. Many classes are changed 
	to interfaces. A change tool eases the adoption of these new interfaces.<br />
	This is described in <em>V6 Adoption for CGM</em> [<a href="#References">3</a>] 
	and in <em>Geometric Modeler Changes</em> [<a href="#References">4</a>].</li>
</ul>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3>Data Model Changes</h3>
<p>Data is not persistent in documents and files any longer, but in products and 
representations in the database. This has two direct impacts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Persistent data of the V5 applications must be assessed:
	<ul>
		<li>Data linked to objects meant to be visible in the PLM, like products 
		and data that used to persist in the Product document must be remodeled</li>
		<li>Data not linked to visible objects, such as features that were stored 
		in Part or Drawing documents will generally have little changes</li>
		<li>The way to change or reuse data generated by V5 applications in the 
		new V6 Applications must be carefully considered. The File Base Design Import 
		(FBDI) generic import mechanism can be enriched to manage application-specific 
		data. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is described in V6 Adoption for Documents [<a href="#References">5</a>].</p>
	</li>
	<li>The CATDocument object is removed. New patterns are available to load and 
	navigate data in memory, and save it to disk [<a href="#References">6</a>]</li>
	<li>New interactive facilities replace the File selection box.</li>
	<li>The V5 product model is changed to a new unified product model [<a href="#References">7</a>].</li>
	<li>The V5 Modelers whose objects are handled through the feature modeler interfaces 
	rely, in V6, on their own interfaces. Generic changes performed to complete 
	this goal are described here [<a href="#References">8</a>]. </li>
	<li>The V5 Feature Modeler is replaced by functions allowing to update, delete 
	and cut/copy/paste applicative objects as described here [<a href="#References">9</a>].
	</li>
</ol>
<p>To accommodate those changes and take advantage of the new PLM paradigms, APIs 
are changed throughout the different solutions that make up the V6 offering. These 
updates are described in the <em>V6 Adoption</em> sections [<a href="#References">10</a>] 
[<a href="#References">11</a>] [<a href="#References">12</a>] [<a href="#References">13</a>].

<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p>This V6 Adoption overview helps you prepare your applications to adopt V6. The 
proposed methodology consists in determining which part of the application is concerned 
with V6 Adoption, identifying global and local appropriate code changes, applying 
these changes, and building your application to first analyze and correct the build 
time errors or warnings. When the application builds, then look for and fix run 
time errors shown when replaying your scenarios or test objects.</p>
