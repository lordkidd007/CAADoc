<p>Several CD-ROMs can be installed:</p>
<ol>
	<li>CAA API</li>
	<li>3DEXPERIENCE Open Development Toolset for Native Apps, usually shortened in the 
		CAA Encyclopedia as the Native Apps Development Toolset.</li>
</ol>
<p>The API CD-ROM contain the APIs of the V6 brands, such as CATIA, DELMIA, 
SIMULIA, and ENOVIA 
brands. It also contains use cases and 
the CAA Encyclopedia along with 
the Native Apps Development Toolset documentation. The 
Native Apps Development Toolset CD-ROM contains only the Native Apps Development 
Toolset run time part.</p>
<p>The brands' are made up of apps gathered in business themes/domains which are 
organized according to the IFWE Compass User Experience quadrants. An app may be 
equivalent to a modeler, or may contain several modelers. Sometimes, a modeler 
may span over two apps. The common services&nbsp; are also made up of 
modelers. An app or a modeler is in turn made up of one or several frameworks that contain 
the API that can be provided as C++ classes and interfaces, Automation objects, 
and/or web services.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia navigation tree is classified according to these programming 
languages as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Native Apps C++</li>
	<li>Native Apps Automation. </li>
</ul>
<p>For Native Apps C++, the <strong>Common Services</strong> section is divided as 
follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>C++ Programming</strong> dealing with the Object Modeler, the 
		collections, and the C++ services.</li>
	<li><strong>Abstractions</strong> that makes up a middleware layer</li>
	<li><strong>VPM Multidiscipline Collaborations</strong> that offers the PLM 
	Core modeler, the PLM Dictionary, the PLM server access</li>
	<li><strong>User Experience</strong> that offers the user interface 
		modeling components for Wintop applications</li>
	<li><strong>Representation Modelers</strong> that provides the main representation 
	modelers, such as the Geometric modeler, the Feature modeler, the Knowledge 
	Optimization and Knowledge Expert modelers, the Mechanical modeler, the Data 
	Upward Compatibility modeler, and the Behavior modeler. The other representation 
	modelers are located in the brands.</li>
	<li><strong>PLM Foundations</strong> that isolates the APIs and 
		the applications from, but altogether allows for, operating systems and 
		other system required software.</li>
	<li><strong>PLM Services</strong> that manage the query, open, expand, save, 
		and life cycle services.</li>
	<li><strong>PLM Modelers</strong> that provides the core PLM data modelers.</li>
	<li><strong>Interfaces &amp; MultiCAD</strong> to exchange data between either other 
	CAD systems or standard formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Foundations</strong> section is followed by the solutions and modelers you have installed.</p>
<p>A specific <strong>V6 Adoption</strong> section gives you information about the new concepts 
	your existing applications should adopt to take advantage of Dassault Syst&#232;mes&#39; 
	technologies, shows you how to change your code, and give you tips to use the 
	new APIs enabling these technologies.</p>
<p>Then, you will find:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Native Apps Development Toolset</strong> that supplies the tools to design, implement, 
	build, check, and test your C++ applications.</li>
	<li><strong>Rules and Guides</strong> that gives you tips about the API 
		resources supplied, naming conventions, stability, and C++ coding and 
		naming rules, features. You will also find information for Automation 
	and Web Services.</li>
	<li><strong>References</strong> that gathers reference information for the Data 
	Models, the C++, Automation, and Web Services API, and the settings.</li>
	<li><strong>Installations</strong> that details the installation and 
		de-installation procedures, as well as the installation preparation for 
		the coexistence of several Visual Studio levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation is organized as articles classified into the following categories 
using dedicated icons:</p>
<table class="fill">
	<colgroup align="center" span="1">
	</colgroup>
	<tr>
		<th>Icons</th>
		<th>Article Type</th>
		<th>Content</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../CAAIcons/images/I_Overview.gif" alt="Overview"/></td>
		<td>Overview</td>
		<td>Introduction to a given modeler or topic, overall information to figure 
		out where the topic scope is and is not, relationship with the modeler neighborhood.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../CAAIcons/images/I_GettingStarted.gif" alt="Getting Started"/></td>
		<td>Getting Started</td>
		<td>Information helping to start, without having a previous knowledge of 
		the modeler or topic. Usually a use case.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../CAAIcons/images/I_Understanding.gif" alt="Understanding"/></td>
		<td>Understanding</td>
		<td>Explanation of a concept, a mechanism, or a protocol to understand how 
		it works, on what it relies, and how it is interrelated with others.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="../CAAIcons/images/I_HowTo.gif" alt="How To"/></td>
		<td>How To</td>
		<td>Programming macro- and micro-tasks organized as a programming guide.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../CAAIcons/images/I_UseCase.gif" alt="Use Case"/></td>
		<td>Use Case</td>
		<td>Detailed description of a coded example of a modeler&#39;s typical programming 
		scenario that gives you the way to use the APIs supplied with the modeler. 
		The code is delivered in a .edu framework located in the CAADoc directory 
		below the one into which you have installed the API CD-ROM. Only the source 
		files are supplied. You can copy these frameworks in a workspace, build 
		them, and run their use cases to learn about the modeler.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../CAAIcons/images/I_Reference.gif" alt="Reference"/></td>
		<td>Reference</td>
		<td>Dictionary-organized information. The documentation of the classes, 
		interfaces, methods, and global functions for each framework fall into this 
		category.</td>
	</tr>

<p>The types Overview, Getting Started, Understanding, and How To are referred to
