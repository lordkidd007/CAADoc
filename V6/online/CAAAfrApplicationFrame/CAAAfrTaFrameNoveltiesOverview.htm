<h2><a name="GeneralView"></a>The CAA Application Frame General View</h2>
<p>In order to give you a quick glimpse of the novelties brought by the IFWE 
Compass User Experience, lets take a look at the two following screen shots that represent a CAA application 
frame before and after the introduction of IFWE Compass User Experience in V6R2014.</p>

<h2><a name="V6Signature"></a>The IFWE Compass User Experience Signature</h2>
<p>The IFWE Compass User Experience provides a new visual signature, redesigning 
completely global components such as the compass, the access to apps, and 
Search, Impact, Collaborate, Propagate items of the former bottom bar.</p>
<h3><a name="Compass"></a>The Compass</h3>
<p>The usage and functionality of the Compass has completely changed: the new Compass 
provides access to apps, formerly known as workbenches, classified by quadrants, 
replacing the former Start button. The Play button allows to reveal and play available 
experiences. The Compass is now located on the left of the top bar.</p>
<p>The former PLM Compass, located at the bottom of each model window, use to give 
you contextual information on a selected object.</p>
<table>
	<caption style="width: 628px"><strong>The IFWE Compass Versus the Former PLM Compass</strong></caption>
	<tr>

		<img alt="" src="images/CAAOldCompass2.jpg" width="309" height="297"/>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Note: the information that the former PLM compass used to show can now be accessed 
from the &quot;<strong>Information Intelligence</strong>&quot; quadrant of the Compass, 
the east quadrant, in the <kbd><strong>B.I. Essentials</strong></kbd> app.</p>
<h3><a name="GlobalFunctions"></a>The Top Bar</h3>
<p>The global components, namely the Start button, the Search box, the Impact box, 
the Collaborate box and the Propagate box used to be located in the bar at the bottom 
of the application frame. They are now situated in the top bar, at the same level 
as the new Compass.</p>
<p>Lets compare the new top bar with the old bottom bar . The following schema shows 
the new bar above and the old one bellow. The arrows enable you to make the 
connection between the new items and the ones you are familiar with, but the 
relation is not a one to one relation, the IFWE Compass User Experience bringing 
a completely redesigned user interface.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Start Button functionalities can be found in the new Compass.</li>
	<li>The Search Box is replaced by a new Search Box enriched with the 6WTags 
		button.</li>
	<li>The Collaborate Box functionalities can found in &quot;<strong>Me</strong> 
		services&quot; button.</li>
	<li>The Propagate Box functionalities can found in &quot;<strong>Share</strong> 
		services&quot; button.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="CAAWorkbench"></a>How to Access your CAA Apps</h3>
<p>If you have defined your own workbenches, you will need to declare them as
<strong>apps</strong> in a service called <strong>MyApps</strong>[<a href="#References">3</a>]. Once this 
declaration has been done, your apps will be visible in the list of apps 
accessed&nbsp; from the Compass. They will appear in the quadrant you have 
specified in the MyApps server. </p>
<p>When you click on a quadrant of the compass, for example the <kbd>3D</kbd> quadrant, all 3DModeling apps are listed. 
They are classified by alphabetical order. </p>
<p>The following picture is a screenshot that shows partly a list of 3DModeling 
apps:</p>

<h2><a name="MenusToolbars"></a>Suppression of Menu Bar and Toolbars</h2>
<p>With the IFWE Compass User Experience, the menu bar and all the toolbars have 
been suppressed.</p>
<p>These major changes are the most impacting for your CAA applications. In order 
to be compliant with the IFWE Compass User Experience, you will need to relocate your commands 
and toolbars. </p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h2><a name="Actionbar"></a>The Action Bar</h2>
<h3><a name="NewConcept"></a>A New Concept</h3>
<p>The action bar is a new concept intended to present a more unified user 
experience across apps (formerly called workbenches), where all toolbars are contained in 
one single bar displayed at the bottom of the application frame.</p>
<p>The following picture shows a screenshot of the action bar, in the context of 
<kbd>Part Design</kbd> app.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="62" src="images/CAANewActionBar.jpg" width="696"/></p>
<p>The design of the action bar has been guided by the following principles:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Action bar :
		<p>It contains app commands.</p>
	</li>
	<li>A clear organization :
		<p>Commands are organized by sections, so that users only see what is relevant 
		to the current context.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Progressive disclosure :
		<p>The initial appearance can be expanded or customized to gradually introduce 
		complexity. </p>
	</li>
	<li>Multi-platform consistency :
		<p>The action bar supports both touch and mouse/keyboard interactions.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Items"></a>Action Bar Characteristics</h3>
<p>The action bar will be the new location of most of the commands in your 
former CAA toolbars. This section presents the different items of the action 
bar.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/CAAActionBarPres.jpg"/></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>A Fixed Area</strong>:
		<p>This area is always displayed. It houses standard commands that are frequently 
		needed , such as Copy/Paste, Undo/Redo, etc.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sections:</strong>
		<p>Sections represent a new way to group commands in the action bar. One 
		section is visible at the time and can be changed by clicking on another 
		section button. Commands of the action bar necessarily belong to a section.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Primary Commands</strong>:
		<p>They are the most frequently used commands in a section, and are always 
		visible.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Secondary Commands</strong>:
		<p>They are commands that aren't frequently used. They are hidden by default 
		and can be accessed by clicking on a an arrow on the right hand side of 
		the action bar.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Flyouts</strong>:
		<p>They are used to combine very similar commands.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>We will go further into the details of the action bar and sections in the following 
article &quot;IFWE Compass User Experience Adoption Tips"[<a href="#References">1</a>].

<h2><a name="Props"></a>Properties and Option Panels</h2>
<p>Two specific panels host commands that manage properties and options. You are 
able to add your own CAA commands there if it is adequate.</p>
<p>The following screenshots show examples of these two panels in the context of 
the Part Design app.</p>

<h2><a name="MDI"></a>Tabs Instead of Windows</h2>
<p>The CAA application frame is a MDI (Multiple Document Interface) application, 
able to host several model windows as child windows of the main Frame, with one 
window active at the time.</p>
<p>With the IFWE Compass User Experience, the 
windows are now presented as tabs, allowing an easier way to organize and 
navigate across your content.</p>

<h2><a name="Workbench"></a>The Current App</h2>
<p>With the IFWE Compass User Experience, when an app is activated, its title 
and brand appear clearly in the top bar. Before, the active workbench used to be 
represented by a specific toolbar with one icon.</p>
<table>
   <caption style="width: 743px"><strong>The Current App Title Versus the Former Workbench Toolbar</strong></caption>

<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p>V6R2014 features the new IFWE Compass User Experience based on the <b>3D</b>EXPERIENCE 
platform. The impact for your CAA application is mainly the location of your commands in the frame, due to the suppression of the menu bar and all toolbars.</p>
<p>If you have created your own workbenches, you will need to declare them as 
apps in a service called MyApps[<a href="#References">3</a>]. Once your apps are 
declared, they become visible in the compass and all your commands become accessible. Add-ins 
remain accessible. By default, your 
toolbars appear underneath the action bar and a special button in the action bar 
gives you access to the former menu bar if you had commands stored in menus. 
It's possible to interactively add your 
CAA commands in the action bar, via session options customization in the &quot;Me 
services&quot; menu of the top bar.</p>
<p>It is however important to migrate your commands to adopt the IFWE Compass User 
Experience principles and make them accessible from the most adequate location in 
the frame. These migrations can be initiated as from V6R2014. The technical article &quot;IFWE 
Compass User Experience Adoption Tips&quot; will give you all the necessary recommendations 
[<a href="#References">1</a>] . An example of use case migration is described in 
the article &quot;Migration of a CAA Geometry sample&quot; [<a href="#References">2</a>].</p>
