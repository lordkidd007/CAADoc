<h3><a name="BasicObjective"></a>Basic Objective</h3>
<p>The basic objective of this functionality is that, the user will be able to 
manage the files of any External Application (CAD/Non-CAD) in 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform server. 
These MyX-CAD files may be standalone files or it may be an Assembly structure. In 
both these cases we can use this functionality. In this article we have 
described both the cases. </p>
<p>Here use case will navigate through MyX-CAD application With UI reference and 
code reference so that developer will get idea how to create plug inns and 
integration own CAD with 3DEXPERIENCE PlatformV6. </p>
<p>MyX-CAD is developed in the java user could referee this application for own 
development. </p>
<p>The basic steps to go ahead with any of the case are described in the 
Description article of basic and assembly scenario [<a href="#References">8</a>] 
[<a href="#References">9</a>] :</p>
<h3><a name="StandaloneApp"></a>Standalone 
Application - MyX-CAD (CAD/Non CAD)</h3>
<p>The basic requirement of the MyX-CAD which is to be integrated with 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform 
must be able to Save and Load files on the local hard drive.&nbsp; User interface details 
described in the article [<a href="#References">5</a>]. </p>
<p>Mostly here we are dealing with client application (CAD /Non CAD ) which are 
able to save their files locally on hard disk. Considering this, we save user application 
data (files) locally first. It may be a temporary folder for user convenience, 
since in further steps we will be managing this data on servers. Please note 
that though we are saving data locally for now, our final aim is to manage all data on 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform server seamlessly. </p>
<p>Standalone MyX-CAD covers following functionality </p>
<ul>
	<li>Create CAA Component (CAAcmp)</li>
	<li>Create CAA Assembly (CAAasm)&nbsp; </li>
	<li>Open CAA component / CAA assembly </li>
	<li>Save CAA component / CAA assembly on local disk</li>
</ul>
<p>According to MyX-CAD we could see that code for standalone application of MyX-CAD is 
delivered in the<strong><code>CAAVIMyXCAD.edu </code> </strong> Fwk.</p>

<ul>
	<li>MyXCADLauncher -
Application launching MyX-CAD with its addins and its data models
</li>
	<li>AddinsDirectoryPanel -
Panel allowing the user to inform where the addin/data jar files can be found
	</li>
	<li>AddinsLoader -

</li>
	<li>MainFrame -
Object corresponding to the application UI 
</li>
	<li>DataLoader-&nbsp;
Object searching and opening the data jar files</li>
</ul>
<p>Here it is very important to know flow to develop integration application 
(Plug-ins/parsers) for user application.</p>
<h3><a name="Before connection"></a>Before connection</h3>
<p>Here we will be describing the exact flow of the information/command through 
various components/applications and also the operations performed by the 
respective components/applications upon receiving the information/command. For a 
clear understanding, it has been illustrated using a schema [Fig.1]</p>
<p>To begin with user need to install 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server and IEF client. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Start 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server</li>
	<li>Launch IEF client on client machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that even before starting 3DEXPERIENCE Platform Server all this server side setting should satisfied
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Installation of 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server with X-CAD component</li>
	<li>Then CAA X-CAD Integration schema (CSE) installation in case of MyX-CAD. 
	( Here important to see that user has flexibility to create its own X-CAD 
	integration schema (CSE) and install it on 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server [6] ).</li>
	<li>Creating user and assigning roles () details explained in the 
	article [<a href="#References">7</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Connecting User application to DEC"></a>Connecting User application to xCAD </h3>
<p>To proceed with our objective to manage data on server, we will first need to 
get a connection with the server. This connection with the server is 
approved/managed by xCAD architecture [<a href="#References">1</a>]. 
So now we should first connect/interact between MyX-CAD and xCAD. This is done through 
IEF Client, which helps to transfer commands to xCAD through xml files.</p>
<p>Hence the only work of IEF Client is to receive and send xml requests between 
xApp and xCAD. These xml files contain commands to Login, Logout and Check-in, 
Check-out.<br>
Here the important thing to note is, these commands should strictly respect the 
command protocols. These protocols have been illustrated in the respective 
Use-case articles.</p>
<p>LoginIn will give access to communicate with 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server through xCAD. For login we have to provide credentials mentioned as in login article [<a href="#References">3</a>]. For this user need one xml file that is respecting LoginEx command protocol 
[<a href="#References">3</a>].</p>
<p>To write this xml file as per protocol MyX-CAD application have its own xml 
writer/parser and create xml on the 
run as per input/required parameters.</p>
<p>Code for this xml command writer/parser written in <strong>
CAAVIXCADIntegration.edu</strong> fwk</p>

<ul>
	<li>CAAXCADCommandItf
	<ul>
		<li>It creates a request command
</li>
		<li>It sends it thanks to the <strong>CAAIEFExchange</strong> class
</li>
		<li>It treats the response </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>CAALogin-
Class handling the login command
</li>
	<li>CAALogout-
Class handling the logout command
</li>
	<li>CAACheckin-
Class handling the checkin command
</li>
	<li>CAACheckout-
Class handling the checkout command
</li>
	<li>CAAIEFExchange-
Class sending a request file to the IEF through a socket and getting its response
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This use case using MyX-CAD to send and receive xml file to IEF 
client which is running on user local machine. </p>
<p><strong>Please note that user can refer this fwk as reference for XML 
creation and send /receive request to IEF client and generate its own plugin for 
their own application. </strong> </p>
<h3>Managing local Data on 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server through MyX-CAD<a name="Managingdata"></a></h3>
<p>Once we Login, the connection is established and we can now manage our xApp 
data files in 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server.</p>
<p>To manage the files we will have to first Check-in these data files into the 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform server Stream. But the data files can be Standalone or Assembly 
structure (Assembly scenario). </p>
<p><b>Case 1</b>: Standalone file [<a href="#References">8</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Assembly structure file [<a href="#References">9</a>]</p>

<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3>In Short<a name="In Short"></a></h3>
<p>We will have to follow a proper sequence of information flow (through xml), 
in order to manage our External Application data files through 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform. And we 
can manage Standalone as well as Assembly structure through 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform server</p>
