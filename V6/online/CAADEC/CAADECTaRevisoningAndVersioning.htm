      <p>A CAD object undergoes several changes in its lifecycle, before it 
		reaches a final design. X-CAD captures and stores the design history of an 
		object as it evolves in versions and revisions.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>This article introduces users to the concept of Revisions and 
		Versions in X-CAD. A fundamental understanding of this concept is critical 
		as we go ahead on the X-CAD Openness subject.<ul>

<h3><a name="Revisions and Versions"></a>Revisions and Versions</h3>
<p>A Revision is a distinct design of a product and a Version is a Revision's 
iteration. </p>
<p>The revision stream contains versions of CAD objects. A stream is the 
revision and its versions, such as Revision A and all versions checked into that 
revision. The revisions of the CAD objects are referred to as major objects, and 
the versions are referred to as minor objects. All the parts/assemblies or 
drawings that are part of an assembly do not need to have the same revision 
number.</p>
<p>Each time you check in a CAD object into ENOVIA, you must select the target 
revision for that object. You can have multiple revisions of the same product 
under development.</p>
<p>Versions maintains the history of how a particular revision evolved. You can 
create as many versions of a design as you want. Think of a version as a 
Work-In-Progress (WIP).</p>
<p>By default, ENOVIA X-CAD versions all CAD objects checked in. Your Integration 
Administrator can change this default so that a version is created only when a 
design is first checked in and not for subsequent checkins. You can also choose 
not to create a new version when checking in a CAD object, however, the 
Integration Administrator can configure ENOVIA X-CAD so that you cannot disable 
the Create Version option during checkin.</p>
<p>In case, multiple versions of the same drawing is connected to a particular 
design, then only the latest version of the drawing will be displayed in the 
Checkout page. For eg. if drawing D1 A.0 and Drawing D1 B.0 are connected to a 
component C1 A.0, then on applying &quot;Related Drawing&quot; view only Drawing D1 B.0 
will be displayed in the checkout page. You can however choose a revision 
manually for the drawing in the checkout page.</p>

<h3><a name="released revision replacement"></a>Released Revision Replacement</h3>
<p>A previous revision of a node can be replaced by another revision of a child 
node in the same parent structure without creating a new revision of the parent.
</p>
<p>A revision replacement is allowed on any state or after finalization state.</p>
<p>Only revisions higher than the current revision of the child node can be used 
to replace the revision of the node. Revisions of the selected nodes can be 
replaced even if they are not connected to an ECO.</p>
<p>The &quot;Relationship Modification Status in Matrix&quot; attribute on &quot;CAD 
SubComponent&quot; relationship will not be modified and revision replacement is 
considered a non-structural change. Upon replacement, the CAD Subcomponent 
relationship from the parent to the old child is moved.</p>
<p>When the parent with the replaced revision or the new child is EBOM synched, 
then the EC Part corresponding to the new child is replaced in the EBOM 
structure. No warnings are displayed and the EBOM structure is automatically 
updated. No attributes are updated from the replaced design and its EBOM. Only 
users with the CAD Revision Manager role can use this feature.</p>

<h3><a name="revision behavior"></a>Revision Behavior</h3>
<p>When an assembly is revised from the object details page, X-CAD 
connects the assemblies structure from its old revision to the new revision.</p>
<p>When designs which are connected to an ECO are revised, all the connected 
designs are revised by X-CAD individually. During this process, if assembly or 
drawing designs are encountered, X-CAD uses the structure from their old 
revisions. </p>
<p>Whenever a new revision of assembly or drawing design is checked out with the 
&quot;As Stored&quot; view, these designs display the old structure when it is expanded in 
the ENOVIA Open dialog box.</p>
<p>Use the &quot;Latest Version&quot; view in the ENOVIA Open dialog box to open the new 
structure or to view the new structure on expansion. X-CAD rectifies the structure 
under the revised designs once these designs with &quot;Latest Version&quot; view are 
saved in ENOVIA.</p>
<p>It is recommended to never add Family Table for revision through ECO. Family 
Table is revised when one or more instances in the family table are selected for 
revision or added as affected items in ECO. If multiple instances of the same 
family table are added as affected items in ECO, then each instance is revised 
individually resulting in revision of family table object corresponding to each 
instance revision.</p>
<p>It is recommended to always use &quot;Latest Version&quot; for the first checkout/open 
after revision of structure or items in the structure to ensure that all latest 
newly created revisions are checked out.</p>

<h2><a name="In short"></a>In Short</h2><p>The article delves into the concept of Revisioning and 
Versioning of an object in ENOVIA. </p>
<p>A Revision is a distinct design of a product and a Version is an iteration of 
the Revision. It further details the revision behavior. </p>
