<h3><a name="Why Integration with Enovia V6"></a>WHY Integrating Client Application with 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform ?</h3>
<p> Business processes requires a various range of capabilities. Tight integrations between applications and especially with the IP repository referential is mandatory to manage efficiently global process.</p>
<p> Why do I need to integrate my client application to 3DEXPERIENCE Platform?</p>
<ul> 
<li> My application is file based and I want to manage versioning, life cycle, change management and all capabilities enabling full design collaboration.</li>
<li>I need to be navigate on my application data within 3DEXPERIENCE Platform .</li>
<li>I want to get my application integrated with other standard 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; applications though powerful processes.</li>
<li>My application users can be  in different locations and I want a centralized data repository with distributed files vaults.</li>
</ul>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="How Integration with Enovia V6"></a>HOW does X-CAD Enablers tight integration of External 
		Client Application Within 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>X-CAD is a comprehensive workgroup design 
application that allows product designers and their extended supply chains to 
manage the design process and collaborate from one central application, 
independent of the authoring applications they use. X-CAD eliminates 
the need to support multiple CAD workgroup data managers.</li>

<li>X-CAD can be deployed and supported from a central location, while the file locations can be distributed and synchronized around the world. From their design applications (electrical , mechanical or others) users can easily access product design information stored in 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; Live Collaboration database, and use local workspace management on their own desktop to easily compare work-in-progress to the master designs in the 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; Live Collaboration.</li>
<li>2 users interfaces are provided :
	<li>Designer or application user can save , retrieve and manage their data in 
	3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; through specific embedded commands from the Client Application.</li>
<li>Manager, project leader (or any user) can navigate on Application data and perform life cycle or various operations from standard 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform web applications.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Components of DEC Integration"></a>WHAT are the Components of a 
X-CAD based Integration ? </h3>
<p>3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; X-CAD based integration consists of components depicted below 
: </p>
<table style="width: 100%; height: 529px;">

	</tr>
</table>
<h4>3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; X-CAD Server Side :</h4>
<ul> 
<li>Consists of Integration Exchange Framework (IEF) schema 
(for all collaborative products), JPOs, servlets, beans, property files and JSPs 
apart from other contents such as images and resource bundles (valid for all 
centrals)</li>
<li> Includes the commands and menus used to customize X-CAD (valid for all centrals)</li>
<li>Performs business operations such as creating, revisioning, 
modifying, connecting business objects, checking files in or out from business 
objects and so on (valid for all 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; centrals; i.e. Enterprise web 
applications)</li>
<li> Handles File Collaboration Server (FCS) infrastructure to 
handle multiple collaborative products on the same server (valid for all 
centrals)</li>
<li> Configures the product using the Global Configuration 
Object and Local Configuration Product (specific to X-CAD) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Integration Exchange Framework (IEF) Client Workspace Service: </h4>
<ul> 
<li>Has no independent UI and supports all applet mode commands which do not have UI and additional commands with their UI control delegated to the client applications </li>
<li> You cannot log in to this service directly. Logging into Collaborative products connects the service and allows the collaborative products to send other commands through this service </li>
</ul>
<h4>Client side Plug In (CSE) : </h4>
<ul> 
<li>Client side Plug In handles the User Interface for the Integration and also the Socket communication with the Client Workspace Manager (IEF Client). The IEF Client in turn communicates with the 
X-CAD server and with the FCS (File Collaboration Server) for file upload/download using the https protocol.</li>
<li> The Business Logic is under the control of the IEF Client while the UI is delegated to the client tool native User Interface.</li>
</ul>

<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="How &amp; Where to implement"></a>HOW and WHERE to implement Application Integration ?</h3>
<p>The steps involved in implementing an embedded integration inside a client tool with 
X-CAD are listed below: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Defining and Installing the Collaborative Product specific schema</li>
	<li>Defining, Configuring and Setting Integration specific preferences</li>
	<li>Creating a CSE (Client Side Extension), also referred to as the Client 
	Plug In</li>
</ul>
<h4>Defining and Installing the Collaborative Product-specific Schema</h4>
<p>Each collaborative product defines and installs its own schema. Typically, 
this integration-specific schema is derived from the base types installed by 
X-CAD. Technical article &quot;<strong>X-CAD Schema for Client 
Integrations</strong>&quot; [<a href="#References"></a>] which delves in depth, on 
this subject.</p>
<h4>Defining, Configuring and 
Setting Integration-specific preferences</h4>
<p>An Integration is configured and preferences specific to it are set, using 
the Configuration Objects. The GCO (Global Configuration Object) is at the heart 
of the Integration on the server side implying that it is this Business Object 
which primarily governs the behavior of collaborative product. </p>
<p>The GCO governs the data structure (schema) for each integration. It maps the 
types and attributes on the client side to those at the server end. Additionally 
a LCO (Local Configuration Object) configures an individual user's preference 
for a collaborative product. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Creating the Client Side Plug In</h4>
<p>The client side plug In implements the native User Interface which allow us to 
launch (AddIns) and work with the Integration commands. </p>
<p>It further communicates with the IEF Client using sockets. It sends a command 
for execution to the IEF Client. The client processes the request command and 
forwards it to the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; server for execution. The response from 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; is then 
routed through the IEF Client back to the client. Since this communication 
happens in a silent mode, with the UI deployed natively by the client, these 
commands are also termed as &quot;Silent&quot; commands.</p>
<p>This is how Integration clients communicate with the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; server and thus 
realize the client embedded integration with 3DEXPERIENCE Platform .&nbsp;</p>
<h4> Capabilities Scope</h4>
<p>Set of capabilities provided by the integration depends of 
the number of XML based communication protocols that are implemented . In this 
release, following protocols have been documented though use cases. LogIn to 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; *
 	Checking In Application data  to 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; *
 	CheckOut of Application data from 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; * LogOut of 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; *
 </p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<ul>
	<li ><strong>LogIn</strong>to 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; *</li>
	<li ><strong>Checking</strong> In Application Data to 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; *</li>
	<li ><strong>CheckOut</strong> of Application Data from 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; *</li>
	<li ><strong>LogOut</strong>of 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; *</li>
</ul>
	<p> <em>* Mandatory Protocols</em></p>

<p>Use Cases illustrate the steps involved in realizing those operations. 
But it is important to note that the Use Case is limited in its scope vis a vis 
the real integrations. The real integrations will involve implementing an AddIn, 
a native UI, Business Logic to generate the request XML and that to parse the 
response XML etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While the Use Case limits its scope to explaining the Silent Commands 
Protocol. It explains the relevance of the various nodes contained in the 
request and the response XML. The Use Case communicates with the IEF Client 
using the socket protocol inside a dummy Java client, a batch application.</p>

<h3> <a name="Who does what"></a>WHO Does What ?</h3>
<p> X-CAD Infrastructure handles a lot of operations and provides 
silently numerous capabilities. To do so X-CAD take advantage of powerful 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; 
infrastructure .So implementation work to realize external application 
integration within 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; is reduced to the minimum.<br>
To better handle what is managed by Designers Central enablers and what is to be 
implemented to complete the integration, following color code is used across the 
entire documentation.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="Capabilities"></a>WHAT capabilities are provided (for free) in addition to Client side plug in?</h3>

in, additional capabilities will be available from 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; web client ( see X-CAD web 
Apps in above schema) :</p>
<h4>Capability to navigate on objects created from application client </h4>

<h3><a name="to conclude"></a>To Conclude</h3>
<p>In short, the article dealt with the basics of Client applications (CAD, 
non-CAD) Integration with 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; X-CAD. Primarily, a client PlugIn 
(CSE) communicates with the IEF Client (X-CAD client installation) 
using the socket protocol. This IEF client processes the command and forwards it 
to the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform&nbsp; server for execution. On command execution, its response is sent 
back to the Client, routed through the IEF Client. This communication between 
the Client plugIn and the IEF Client is fundamentally XML based, whose 
specifications are well defined by the Silent Commands Protocol.
</p>
<p>The X-CAD Openness for client Integration is afforded since this client plugIn-IEF 
Client communication is fundamentally XML based. Use Cases limit their scope to 
delve into the relevance of the contents of this XML, and relies on a dummy 
Java-based client to execute commands on the server. The real integrations will 
involve implementing the Client side Plug-ins, the native UI, BL to generate and 
parse the XML etc.</p>
