<h3><a name="BasicObjective"></a>Basic Objective</h3>
<p>The basic objective of this functionality is that, the user will be able to 
manage the files of any External Application (CAD/Non-CAD) in 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform server. 
These xApp files may be standalone files or it may be an Assembly structure. In 
both these cases we can use this functionality. In this article we have 
described both the cases. </p>
<p>The basic steps to go ahead with any of the case are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Before Connection: The installations which you need to do</li>
	<li>Save files Locally: This is the minimum functionality which should be 
	present in the xApp</li>
	<li>Connecting xApp and 3DEXPERIENCE Platform: This is the basic connection required to 
	proceed with any of the scenario. It means Login.</li>
	<li>Managing xApp files on 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Before connection"></a>Before connection</h3>
<p>Here we will be describing the exact flow of the information/command through 
various components/applications and also the operations performed by the 
respective components/applications upon receiving the information/command. For a 
clear understanding, it has been illustrated using a schema [Fig.1]</p>
<p>To begin with user need to install 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server and IEF client. Make sure that all basic setups 
are done as mentioned in detail in the [<a href="#References">2</a>] article. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Start 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server</li>
	<li>Launch IEF client on client machine</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Propagate Files on local  from user application (CAD/Non CAD)"></a>Save Files locally from user 
Application - xApp (CAD/Non CAD)</h3>
<p>The basic requirement of the xApp which is to be integrated with 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform must 
be able to Save and Load files on the local hard drive i.e. the Application 
files folder as shown in <a href="#Fig1">Fig.1</a></p>
<p>Mostly here we are dealing with client application (CAD /Non CAD ) which are 
able to save their files locally on hard disk. Considering this, we save user application 
data (files) locally first. It may be a temporary folder for user convenience, 
since in further steps we will be managing this data on servers. Please note 
that though we are saving data locally for now, our final aim is to manage all data on 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform server seamlessly. </p>
<p>Here it is very important to know flow to develop integration application 
(Plug-ins/parsers) for user application. We could refer MyX-CAD application for 
reference [<a href="#References">4</a>].</p>
<h3><a name="Connecting User application to DEC"></a>Connecting User application 
to X-CAD </h3>
<p>To proceed with our objective to manage data on server, we will first need to 
get a connection with the server. This connection with the server is 
approved/managed by X-CAD architecture i.e. X-CAD Foundation in the <a href="#Fig1">Fig.1.</a> So now we 
should first connect/interact between User xApp and X-CAD [<a href="#References">4</a>]. This is done through 
IEF Client, which helps to transfer commands to X-CAD through xml files.</p>
<p>Hence the only work of IEF Client is to receive and send xml requests between 
xApp and X-CAD. These xml files contain commands to Login, Logout and Check-in, 
Check-out.<br>
Here the important thing to note is, these commands should strictly respect the 
command protocols. These protocols have been illustrated in the respective 
Use-case articles.</p>
<p>LoginIn will give access to communicate with 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server through 
X-CAD. For login we have to provide credentials mentioned as in login article [<a href="#References">2</a>]. For this user need one xml file that is respecting LoginEx command protocol 
[<a href="#References">3</a>].</p>
<p>To write this xml file, application could have its own parser and create xml on the 
run as per input/required parameters. As we know how to launch use case article [<a href="#References">2</a>] we 
have mentioned process for launching use case in addition to that we have provided one 
sample login xml file and xApp Sample client.</p>
<p>This use case using xAppSampleClient to send and receive xml file to IEF 
client which is running on user local machine. More info about this xApp 
sample mentioned in next two sections. </p>
<h3>Managing local Data on 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server through X-CAD<a name="Managingdata"></a></h3>
<p>Once we Login, the connection is established and we can now manage our xApp 
data files in 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server.</p>
<p>To manage the files we will have to first Check-in these data files into the 
3DEXPERIENCE Platform server Stream. But the data files can be Standalone or Assembly 
structure (Assembly scenario). </p>
<p><b>Case 1</b>: Standalone file</p>
<table>
	<caption>Fig. 1 Information flow Schema for a Standalone xApp file<a name="Fig1"></a></caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAADECTaDescriptionSchema.jpg" width="689" height="755"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>In this case (Fig.1) we have a standalone xApp data file which is now to be 
checked-in into 3DEXPERIENCE Platform server.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For this we will have to now send the check-in command protocols through 
	a xml file to IEF Client [<a href="#References">3</a>].</li>
	<li>IEF Client will send it to X-CAD which will interact with the 
	3DEXPERIENCE Platform 
	MCS as shown in Fig.1.</li>
	<li>Then 3DEXPERIENCE Platform MCS will instantiate the Customer types from PLM Dictionary 
	and send the answer to IEF Client through X-CAD.</li>
	<li>IEF Client will then send request to 3DEXPERIENCE Platform FCS server to Check-in 
	the xApp data files into the Stream</li>
	<li>Once the check-in is done, we can now manage these data files using 
	X-CAD 
	Web Apps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Assembly structure file - we will see it in Assembly 
scenario.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3>In Short<a name="In Short"></a></h3>
<p>We will have to follow a proper sequence of information flow (through xml), 
in order to manage our External Application data files through 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform. And we 
can manage Standalone as well as Assembly structure through 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform server</p>
