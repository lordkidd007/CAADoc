<h2><a name="Principles"></a>Instance Positioning Principles</h2>
<p>Our article illustrates the concepts of positioning a product instance using 
the model depicted below. Its what we call as the &quot;Double Skate&quot; model, 
since it consists of two elementary skate assemblies.</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>The model (rather fictional) consists of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Two elementary Skates, each made up of two Axles (named AxleAssy) and a 
		Board. The AxleAssy is made up of two wheels and an Axle (name Axle).</li>
	<li>The right Skate (named S1) has its right (or Front) AxleAssy closer to the 
		board's border vis a vis the left Skate (named S2).</li>
	<li>On Skate S2, the wheels of the rear AxleAssy are more on the periphery vis 
		a vis S1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put on your helmet and knee protection, we start.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="WithoutOverloading"></a>Positioning Without Overloading</h3>
<p>We begin by creating the Skate.</p>
<p>The first step involves creating an AxleAssy, comprising of an Axle and two Wheel 
instances at either end of the Axle as depicted by the next picture.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Fig. 2 The AxleAssy</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="AxleAssy" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg12.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Let us explain how we got this model.</p>
<p>On instantiation of the two wheels, they are seen as overlapped one over the 
other in the AxleAssy. The two Wheels and the Axle are located at the position absolute 
(0,0,0) in the global coordinate system of the AxleAssy.<br />
</p>
<table>
	<caption>Fig. 3 AxleAssy On Initial Creation</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="AxleAssy On Initial Creation" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg10.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Now, it is known we have two distinct data models associated with a Product namely. 
the Occurrence and the Ref-Inst model. Both these models for the AxleAssy are depicted 
in the schema that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 1 AxleAssy Data Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="AxleAssy Data Model" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg14.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>We proceed to relocate the two Wheels at either end of the Axle. To accomplish 
this, two possibilities exist. Either we position the wheel Occurrence or its related 
Instance. In either case, the resulting model is as depicted in the Schema 2 that 
follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 2 Wheels Positioned at Axle Ends</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Wheels Positioned at Axle Ends" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg16.jpg"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>Position the left wheel at M1 and right wheel at M2, absolute positions 
		relative to the global co-ordinate system of the AxleAssy. The associated 
		occurrences and their related instances are seen positioned at M1 and M2</li>
</ul>
<p>We next proceed to create the Skate. The Skate comprises of a board with two 
AxleAssy positioned at either end of the board as depicted in the picture that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig4">Fig. 4</a> The Complete Skate</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Complete Skate" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg17.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>To begin with, we will have the two AxleAssy overlapping one another as seen 
below. The AxleAssy and the Board are positioned at absolute (0,0,0) in the global 
co-ordinate system of the Skate.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Fig. 5 Skate on Creation</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Skate on Creation" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg22.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The schema that follows, represents the data model of the Skate on creation.
<br />
</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 3. The Data Model of Skate on Creation</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Data Model of Skate on Creation" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg1F.jpg"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>The Front and the Rear AxleAssy are positioned at the origin (the absence 
		of the position matrix in the schema, indicates placement at Origin).</li>
	<li>The Left and Right wheels were positioned at M1 and M2 respectively, in 
		the earlier step for both models.</li>
</ul>
<p>We proceed further to reposition the two AxleAssy at either end of the Board. 
That will create a complete Skate, as depicted in [<a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>] 
above. The schema representing the data model of the complete skate follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 4 The Data Model of the Complete Skate</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Data Model of the Complete Skate" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg1C.jpg"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>M3/M4 is the absolute position matrix of the front and the rear AxleAssy 
		in the global coordinate system of the Skate.</li>
	<li>M1/M2 is the absolute position matrix of the left and the right wheel occurrences/instances.</li>
	<li>The position of each wheel (in 3D Data model) is the product of the position 
		matrix of each occurrence beginning with that under Root to the Wheel occurrence. 
		Thus the position matrix for the rear left wheel in 3D (in red) is M4 (rear 
		AxleAssy occurrence) X M1 (Left Wheel occurrence).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us proceed to reposition one of the wheels in the Skate assembly. We 
will relocate the rear right wheel to <strong>M4xMX</strong> as depicted in the 
3D Model within the figure that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 5. The Data Model of a Skate on Repositioning its Wheel Occurrence</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Repositioning Wheel Occurrence" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg3.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>The rear right wheel was repositioned in 3D at <strong>M4xMX</strong> (in 
		bold red in the 3D model).</li>
	<li>It results in the right wheel occurrence and its related instance getting 
		repositioned to MX.</li>
	<li>This results in the front right wheel getting repositioned to <strong>M3xMX</strong> 
		in 3D.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, if an entity inside a 3D Model is repositioned, its associated Occurrence 
(and related Instance) is relocated. The impact is then propagated to all associated 
Occurrences in the 3D model.</p>

<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction to Overloaded Position, Flexibility &amp; Repositionability Concept</h3>
<p>Did you notice in the previous case, repositioning the rear right wheel resulted 
in repositioning the front right wheel as well ? But, this may not be our expectation. 
We may want for example, only the two front wheels to be drawn closer, without affecting 
the rear wheels, as the picture that follows indicates.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Fig. 6 Skate with the Closer Front Wheels</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Closer Front Wheels" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg5.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In other words, the position of the front two wheel occurrences is specific to 
the Skate context. Meaning, it is overloaded in the skate context. The schema that 
follows represents the data model for the skate with its front wheels drawn 
closer to one another.</p>
<table>
	<caption><br />
	Schema 6. Skate Data Model with Closer Front Wheels</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Closer Front Wheels" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg7.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>The front left wheel is repositioned at M3x<strong>M1'</strong>, while the 
		front right wheel is repositioned to M3X<strong>M2'</strong>, as depicted 
		in the 3D model.</li>
	<li><strong>M1'</strong> is the position matrix of the left wheel 
		occurrence, locally in the Skate context (while that of its related instance 
		is M1).</li>
	<li><strong>M2'</strong> is the position matrix of the right wheel occurrence, 
		locally in the Skate context (while that of its related instance is M2).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the matrix of an Occurrence is not the same as its related Instance, the 
position of the Occurrence is said to be overloaded. Two obvious questions that 
arise here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Who stores this overloaded information? The answer is it is the Reference-Instance 
		model which stores this information (M1', M2'), which is retrieved each 
		time we recreate the Skate occurrence model, and other occurrences model 
		which are built over the Skate occurrence model (like the &quot;Double Skate&quot; 
		in the next section).</li>
	<li>How is this overloading accomplished?
		<p>This is possible if the AxleAssy Reference is made &quot;<strong>flexible</strong>&quot;, 
		and the two wheel instances in it, are &quot;<strong>repositionable</strong>&quot;.</p>
		<p>You may either open AxleAssy reference standalone or in the Skate context, 
		the AxleAssy be UI-Activated. The using the &quot;<strong>Properties</strong>&quot; 
		command, the &quot;<strong>Mechanical Behavior</strong>&quot; page, you 
		check the &quot;<strong>Flexible</strong> <strong>at Instantiation</strong>&quot; 
		button, and you check the two instances of Wheel as &quot;<strong>Repositionable</strong>&quot;.</p>

	</li>
</ul>
<p>We proceed to a more generic explanation on this subject of &quot;<strong>Position 
Overloading</strong>&quot;.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Detail"></a>Overloaded Position in detail</h3>
<p>In order to introduce a generality in our discussion, we'll have to introduce 
another level in our Occurrence data model. It is why we propose a &quot;Double 
Skate&quot; model, which consists of two elementary skate assemblies, as depicted 
in the [<a href="#Fig8">Fig.8</a>] that follows ( same as [<a href="#Fig1">Fig.1</a>] 
)</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig8">Fig. 8</a> The Double Skate Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Double Skate Model" height="230" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg6.gif" width="436"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>It simply consists of two instances of the Skate reference namely. S1 and S2.</p>
<p>A significant point to note here is that in S1 (right skate assembly), the front 
AxleAssy is closer to the skate board's border. Also in S2 (left skate assembly) 
you'll notice the wheels of the rear AxleAssy are more towards the periphery. These 
are the two cases of &quot;overloaded occurrences&quot; in the &quot;Double Skate&quot; 
context.</p>
<p>To begin with, we create the &quot;Double Skate&quot; assembly, simply by positioning 
S1 at M5, and S2 at M6. The model is depicted in the schema that follows. Of course, 
you see the two skates distinctly (not overlapped) since we have located them at 
distinct locations (M5, M6).</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 7 Data Model of a Double Skate on Creation</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Data Model of a Double Skate on Creation" src="images/CAAPstPositioningDoubleSkate01.png"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong> (you can skip at the first reading): On the occurrence 
model (on left schema.7 just above) notice the position associated with the S1-left-front 
wheel occurrence is not M1, the matrix of its related instance, but M1&#8217; the 
overloaded matrix of the left-front wheel in the Skate context. It could be sound 
strange according to the instance/reference model presented on right of schema.7. 
Indeed, with this instance/reference model, when the occurrence model is computed, 
the S1-left-front wheel occurrence should be M1. It is due to the fact that the 
presented instance/reference model is not complete. It does not show the occurrence 
information of the sub-contexts. Don&#8217;t forget that the instance/reference 
model is the only one to be stored in database, while an occurrence model is never 
stored. But when occurrences are overloaded like on Schema .6, the instance / reference 
model keeps the necessary information to be able to recreate the same occurrence 
model or a upper occurrence model ( like the &#8220;double-skate&#8221;).</p>
<p>We next proceed to overload the occurrences in the &quot;Double Skate&quot; context, 
so that we have the final model as depicted in the [<a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>] 
above</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 8 Data Model of a Double Skate on Overloading</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Data Model of a Double Skate on Overloading" src="images/CAAPstPositioningDoubleSkate02.png"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The overloaded occurrences in the &quot;Double Skate&quot; context, are circled 
in red above, in the Occurrences model. You will find that the two S2-rear AxleAssy 
Wheels are overloaded (more towards the periphery, <strong>M1''</strong>,
<strong>M2''</strong>) and the S1-Front AxleAssy is closer to the board (<strong>M3'</strong>)</p>
<p>To realize this model you will have to do the steps listed below</p>
<ul>
	<li>To move the S1-Front AxleAssy independently (in the &quot;Double Skate&quot; 
		context), the Skate Reference will have to be rendered flexible, and within 
		it, the Front AxleAssy instance will have to be rendered repositionable.</li>
	<li>To move the two S2-rear AxleAssy Wheels independently, we will have to:
		<ul>
			<li>the AxleAssy Reference will have to be rendered flexible, and within 
				it, the two Wheel instances will have to be further rendered repositionable
				<strong>AND</strong>.</li>
			<li>The Skate Reference will have to be flexible and in the Skate context 
				the Occurrence &quot;Wheel&quot; must be repositionable.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is effectively summed up by the schema that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Schema9">Schema 9</a> Reference Flexibility and Instance/Occurrence 
	Repositionability</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Reference Flexibility and Instance/Occurrence Repositionability" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimgD.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>A significant point to note in the schema above is that when an occurrence at 
first level (say the Front AxleAssy) is to be set repositionable, it is the related 
instance which is set repositionable. This is because the instances are tightly 
bound to the occurrences at the first level.</p>
<p>Now with this configuration, the schema that follows represents the occurrences 
which can be potentially overloaded and those which have been actually overloaded 
resulting in our model depicted in [<a href="#Schema9">Schema 9</a>] above.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 10 Potentially Overloadable Occurrences and Overloaded Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Potentially Overloadable Occurrences and Overloaded Model" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg4.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>On the left, we have the occurrence model which represents in green, those 
		occurrences which can be potentially overloaded.</li>
	<li>On the right, we have the occurrence model after we have the occurrences 
		overloaded, those represented in red. You'll find we have overloaded the 
		Front AxleAssy of Skate1 and the two wheels of the rear AxleAssy of Skate2.</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude, <strong>to overload an occurrence</strong>, the rule is for all 
the occurrences from the one just below the root to the occurrence aggregating the 
one for overload:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The references of these occurrences must be flexible.</li>
	<li>In the occurrence model computed from these references, the occurrence/instance 
		(for first occurrence) corresponding to the one to be repositioned, must 
		also be repositionable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pay Attention</strong>: While reading this TA, you may have an impression 
that the person who intends to overload an occurrence will render flexibility to 
references and repositionability to instances/occurrences. It is possible, but it 
is usually not the case. In fact, it is for the person responsible for a reference 
to decide the flexibility status (on/off) for the reference, and further, which 
instances/occurrences beneath it will be be rendered repositionable.</p>

<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Removal"></a>Flexibility and Repositionability Removal</h3>
<p>To finish this section, we have to explain the consequences of rendering a reference 
inflexible or one of its instances/occurrences no longer repositionable, on an occurrence 
which is overloaded. This section might be very technical for beginners, and so 
it is recommended they skip it for the moment.</p>
<p>When a reference is no more flexible, all its instances/occurrences which were 
so far repositionable, cease to be so. We explain that with the schema 11 that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Schema11">Schema 11</a> Consequences of Disabling Flexibility</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Consequences of Disabling Flexibility" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg7.jpg"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>On [<a href="#Schema11">schema 11</a>] we consider an instance (for eg. a wheel) 
used across several occurrences model. As we progress from left to right, we add 
a level to the occurrences data model (AxleAssy, Skate, DoubleSkate, QuadSkate)</p>
<p>In the first model, the position matrix for the wheel occurrence is represented 
by M1. As we progress to the right M2, M3 and M4 are the overloaded matrices in 
the respective contexts.</p>
<p>Now we consider possible configurations on removing the flexibility of the references:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AxleAssy is not more flexible. In this case, M2 becomes M1 and so do, M3 
		and M4.</li>
	<li>Skate is no more flexible. In this case M2 remains M2, while M3 and M4 become 
		M2.</li>
</ul>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Fixity"></a>Fix versus Movable Instance</h3>
<p>In order to secure the position of an instance, you can "fix" it. This capability 
is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>switchable at any moment. An instance can be "fix" and then "movable", and 
		conversely.</li>
	<li>Fully integrated in DS applications and engines:
		<ul>
			<li>Compass.</li>
			<li>CAA API CATIMovable. When an instance is &quot;fix&quot;, <em>CATIMovable</em> 
				fails.</li>
			<li>PLM Update : Fix instance is seen as fix object in Assembly Design.</li>
			<li>All application that can modify the position persistency on an instance.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This &quot;fix&quot; property has <strong>no influence</strong> on the capacity 
of an occurrence of a fix instance to overload its position matrix. The referenced 
use case illustrates all these concepts [<a href="#References">1</a>].</p>

<h2><a name="APIs"></a>Instance Position by APIs</h2>
<p>Since this article is independent of a programming language, you'll not find 
any reference to an API in it. The APIs are specifically dealt in various Use Cases 
we have created for each. The focus here is on the common principles which follow:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Handling the position of an Occurrence or Instance.</li>
	<li>Handling the position in an absolute coordinate system.</li>
	<li>Handling the position in a local coordinate system.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="OccurrenceInstance"></a>Occurrence and Instance Position</h3>
<p>In the instance/ reference model, only instances are movable, while in the occurrence 
model, except for the root occurrence, all other occurrences are movable.</p>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="PositionMatrix"></a>Position Matrix</h3>
<p>A Position Matrix is an entity defined by 12 floats as depicted below:</p>
<pre>[0] [3] [6] [9] <br />
[1] [4] [7] [10] <br />
[2] [5] [8] [11]</pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Coefficients from 0 to 8 define the (3x3) transformation matrix.</li>
	<li>Coefficients from 9 to 11 define the (x, y, z) vector position.</li>
</ul>
<p>The matrix must be reversible.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Instance"></a>Instance Position</h3>
<p>When you work with Instances in a Ref-Inst model, irrespective of the used method 
(Absolute or not), you directly work on the instance. Have a look to this schema.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 12 Handling Instance Matrix</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Handling Instance Matrix" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg9.jpg"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>When you modify or retrieve the matrix of the Right Wheel, you modify or 
		retrieve the Matrix of the instance (in this case, M2).</li>
	<li>When you modify or retrieve the matrix of the Front AxleAssy, you modify 
		or retrieve the matrix of the instance, yet again (in this case, M3).</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with an Ref-Inst model (handling positions, specifically) is relevant 
while we build an assembly, but otherwise we recommend working with an occurrence 
model, which is more accurate and safe, since the values of the overloaded matrices 
are stored inside an occurrence model.</p>
<p><strong>Example of a Dangerous Scenario:</strong> If the position of the front left wheel 
(Skate Schema 6) is computed, using the Ref-Inst model, it will work out to M1xM3, 
where M1 is the position matrix for the left wheel instance, while M3 is that for 
the front AxleAssy instance. This result is incorrect, since in the Skate context 
the front wheels were drawn closer to the centre and its position is M1'xM3</p>

		right wheel occurrence (bold yellow dashed), to the position M8, since this 
		occurrence is repositionable, the position of only the occurrence 
		is changed. The Ref-Inst model remains unchanged.</li>
	<li>Irrespective of the context (Absolute or Intrinsic) when we move the front 
		Axle Occurrence (orange bold), to the position M9, since this occurrence 
		is not repositionable, its related instance is repositioned to M9 and further 
		all occurrences associated with this instance are also impacted (orange 
		in the occurrence model). The two axles move on the Skate.</li>
</ul>
<p>To complete this discussion of &quot;Writing an Occurrence Position&quot; we 
must introduce another level to this Occurrence Model. We now use the &quot;Double 
Skate&quot; model with a slight difference, which will let us be more exhaustive 
in our examples that follow. Please take a look at the schema that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 16 Impact on Modifying a Non-Repositionable Occurrence</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Impact on Modifying a Non-Repositionable Occurrence" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg3.jpg"/>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In the schema above, we have three occurrence models. The color conventions we 
have followed is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the coordinate system is not shown, it implies the occurrence cannot 
		be overloaded.</li>
	<li>A green coordinate system indicates the occurrence can be overloaded (potentially 
		yes).</li>
	<li>A red coordinate system indicates, the occurrence is overloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>By consequence, you will observe that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the double skate, only the front AxleAssy can be overloaded, and S1-Front 
		is overloaded.</li>
	<li>On the simple skate all the wheels can be overloaded, and the ones on the 
		front AxleAssy are overloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now present several configurations wherein we modify the position of 
an occurrence within the &quot;Double Skate&quot; occurrence model. The first 
two are based on the same concept as previously:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Irrespective of the context (Absolute or Intrinsic), when we move the front 
		AxleAssy occurrence since these are repositionable, the position of only 
		the modified occurrence is changed. (You'll notice the front AxleAssy of 
		S1 is overloaded while not that of S2).</li>
	<li>Irrespective of the context (Absolute or Intrinsic) when we move the rear 
		Axle occurrence since these are not repositionable, the position of its 
		related instance is changed and further all occurrences associated with 
		this instance are impacted. The two rear AxleAssy move in the Double Skate 
		context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us now consider a concrete example. We move the S1-Front Left Wheel, marked 
in orange bold to the position M9, in Schema 17 that follows. The result is also 
depicted in the following schema.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Schema 17</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Schema 17" src="images/CAAPstPositioningProdInstimg4.jpg"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>Since the S1-Front Left Wheel occurrence cannot be overloaded, the position 
		of its related instance updates to M9 (orange in the Axle model).</li>
	<li>In the skate model, the non-overloaded left wheel repositions to M9 too 
		(bold yellow in the skate occurrence).</li>
	<li>In the Double Skate model, we have two occurrences at M9 (bold yellow in 
		double skate), the instantiation of the non overloaded occurrences of the 
		Skate model.</li>
</ul>
