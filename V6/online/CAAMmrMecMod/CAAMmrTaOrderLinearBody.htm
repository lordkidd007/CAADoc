<h2><a name="100000"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Order and Absorption concepts were introduced to help user with the design of 
very complex geometry, for which the specification graph can become really huge.</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#200000">Order Concept</a>
		<p>An ordered set is a set in which each feature can only reference features 
		that are above it in the specification tree. The effect is that the order 
		of appearance of the features in the specification graph is consistent with 
		the steps of creation of the design, with the basic features at the top 
		and the most complex features at the bottom. The notion of <strong>current 
		feature</strong> helps to implement this rule.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="#300000">Absorption Concept</a>
		<p>Some features modify other features. The visualization of the feature 
		before its modification is not revelant for the user, only the final result 
		is usefull. The absorption concept is the fact of not taking into account 
		non relevant features, these are &quot;absorbed&quot;. The modified features 
		are called <strong>absorbed</strong> features, and the modifying features 
		are named <strong>absorbent</strong> features.</p>

<h2><a name="200000"></a>Order Concept</h2>
<h3><a name="210000"></a>Input Specifications in an Ordered Set</h3>
<p>In ordered sets, <strong>the input specifications of a feature can only be features 
that are above it in the specification tree.</strong></p>
<p>Note: this rule only applies to features that are within the same set.</p>
<table>
	<caption><strong>Input Specifications in an Ordered Set</strong></caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" height="191" src="images/CAAMmrOGSOrder.jpg" width="372"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><code>Spline.1</code> has <code>Point.1</code>, <code>Point.2</code>, <code>Point.3</code> 
and <code>Point.4 for inputs.</code> It couldn't have <code>Point.5</code> or
<code>Point.6</code>. <code>Line.1</code> has <code>Point.4</code> and <code>Point.5</code> 
for inputs. It could not have <code>Point.6</code>.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>CATFeatureImportAgent</strong></em> is an agent of selection 
dedicated to mechanical features. It takes into account the fact that in an ordered 
set, an input feature below the current feature cannot be selected. This rule only 
applies to features whithin the ordered set, there are no constraints on input features 
coming from another set.</p>
<p>The following picture shows that when editing Line.1 and trying to modify one 
of its points, it's not possible to select a point that is below in the specification 
tree:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" height="274" src="images/CAAMmrOGSnosele.jpg" width="442"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>When trying to replace <code>Point.5</code> by <code>Point.6,</code> which is 
below <code>Line.1</code> in the specification tree, the tool tip is displayed, 
the point is not selectable.</p>

<h3><a name="220000"></a>The Current Feature</h3>
<p>The notion of <strong>current feature</strong> was introduced to help user respect 
the order rules when designing his geometry within an ordered set. It's a status 
on a feature that generates certain behaviors concerning new feature insertion and 
visualization. There is always one and only one current object in a 3D Shape, it 
appears underlined in the Specification Tree.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>CATIMmiUsePrtPart</strong></em> interface implemented by the 
Part Feature enables to manage the current feature. The way to set and get the current 
feature is described in the article &quot;The Part Feature&quot; [<a href="#References">1</a>].
</p>
<p>Here are the different behaviors linked to the current feature:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><strong>A new feature is inserted just below the current feature and 
		automatically becomes the current feature</strong></p>
		<p>Lets create a new point in the example just above, with Line.1 as current 
		feature. The picture below shows that the new point, Point.7, was inserted 
		just below <code>Line.1</code> and has become the current feature.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="218" src="images/CAAMmrOGSNewFeat.jpg" width="333"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Note: In a non ordered surfacic feature set, <code>Point.7</code> would 
		have been automatically aggregated at the end of the set, that is to say 
		after Plane.1.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>When editing a feature, it becomes the current feature</strong></p>
		<p>The picture below shows an example of an edited Line:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="360" src="images/CAAMmrOGSCurrent.jpg" width="424"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>When <code>Line.1</code> is edited, it becomes the current feature, underlined 
		in the specification tree.</p>
		<p>Remark: another way to interactively set a feature as current feature, 
		is to use the command &quot;Define in Work Object&quot;, available in the 
		contextual menu of the selected object.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Only the features above the current feature are visualized in the 
		3D viewer</strong>
		<p>The following picture shows the 3D viewer when all the elements of the 
		ordered set are visible, the current feature being the last feature in the 
		specification tree:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="299" src="images/CAAMmrOGSAllElt.jpg" width="368"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Now, in the same example, lets set Line.1 as current feature. The following 
		picture shows that the features below Line.1 are not visualized:</p>
		<table>
			<caption>Features Below the Current Feature are not Drawn</caption>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="300" src="images/CAAMmrOGSCurrentLine.jpg" width="354"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p><code>Point.7</code>, <code>Point.6</code> and <code>Plane.1</code> are 
		not drawn in the 3D Viewer.</p>
		<p>So when editing <code>Line.1</code>, the user is not disturbed by the 
		features located below it, and cannot select them in the 3D viewer.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="300000"></a>Absorption Concept</h2>
<p>Lets compare the following two pictures that represent a Split operation in an 
non ordered set on the right and in an ordered set on the left:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Non Ordered Set</th>
		<th>Ordered Set</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Non Ordered Set" height="205" src="images/CAAMmrOGSPartwithGS.jpg" width="289"/></td>
		<td>
		<img alt="Ordered Set" height="206" src="images/CAAMmrOGSPartwithOGS.jpg" width="318"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Both pictures show the split of the surface <code>Extrude.1</code> by the plane
<code>Plane.1</code>. The 3D visualization of the result is the same: you can only 
see <code>Split.1</code>, and <code>Extrude.1</code> is not visible. But if you 
look at the specification tree, you can see that on the left picture, <code>Extrude.1</code> 
has the hidden icon, and on the right, its icon is normal. This means that if you 
swap the visible space, <code>Extrude.1</code> of the Geometrical Set (on the left) 
will be drawn, while <code>Extrude.1</code> inside the Ordered Set will not be.</p>
<p>Once <code>Split.1</code> is created, <code>Extrude.1</code> has become visually 
useless for the design. <code>Split.1</code> is said to be an <strong>absorbent</strong> 
feature <code>and Extrude.1</code> an <strong>absorbed</strong> feature.</p>
<p>Lets review the different behaviours linked to the absorption concept:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Absorbed Feature Visualization</strong>
		<p>As we have seen in the precedent paragraph, only features above the current 
		feature are visualized. The consequence is that the visualization of the 
		absorbed feature depends on the position of the current feature. There are 
		three cases:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The current feature is above the absorbed feature : the absorded 
				feature is not visualized.
				<p>The following picture illustrates this case:</p>
				<img alt="" height="216" src="images/CAAMmrOGSAbsorbedFeatVisu.jpg" width="303"/>
				<p>Only <code>Point.1</code>, <code>Point.2</code>, <code>Point.3</code>,
				<code>Point.4</code> and <code>Spline.1</code> are visualized in 
				the 3D view.</p>
			</li>
			<li>The current feature is in between the absorbed feature and its absorbent 
				feature : the aborbed feature is visualized (this is the unique 
				case where the absorbed feature is visualized).
				<p>The following picture illustrates this case:</p>
				<p>
				<img alt="" height="211" src="images/CAAMmrOGSBetween.jpg" width="362"/></p>
				<p><code>Extrude.1</code> is displayed in the 3D view. At this stage 
				of the history of the set (<code>Plane.1</code> is the current feature),
				<code>Extrude.1</code> has not been modified yet by <code>Split.1</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>The current feature is the absorbent feature or after, the absorbent 
				feature is visualized and the absorbed feature isn't.
				<p>The following picture illustrates this case:</p>
				<img alt="" height="208" src="images/CAAMmrOGSPartwithOGS2.jpg" width="360"/>
				<p><code>Extrude.1</code> isn't displayed, it has been absorbed 
				by <code>Split.1</code>.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Absorbed Feature Selection</strong>
		<p>It's not possible to select an absorbed feature for an operation, even 
		if it's above the current feature.</p>
		<p>In the precedent sample, with <code>Split.1</code> as current feature, 
		if you try to create an offset of <code>Extrude.1</code>, you will get the 
		following error message when trying to select <code>Extrude.1</code>:</p>
		<table>
			<caption>Absorbed Feature Selection</caption>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="326" src="images/CAAMmrOGSPartwithOGSorder.jpg" width="589"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The <em><strong>CATFeatureImportAgent</strong></em> interface takes into 
		account this rule: an absorbed feature cannot be selected. Thus, selection 
		in the specification tree is compliant with what is drawn in 3D viewer.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Absorbent Feature Insertion</strong>
		<p>It is possible to insert an absorbent feature in between an absorbed 
		feature and its absorbent feature. Do do that, the absorbed feature needs 
		to be visualized, so the current feature must be a feature in between the 
		absorbed feature and the absorbent feature. In this configuration, the absorbed 
		feature is at a stage in the history of the specifications where it has 
		not yet been modified by an operation.</p>
		<p>Let's consider the precedent sample and set <code>Extrude.1</code> as 
		current feature. Let's then create <code>Plane.2</code> and <code>Split.2</code>. 
		These two new features are inserted before <code>Split.1</code>.</p>
		<p>The following picture shows the result of this scenario:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="235" src="images/CAAMmrOGSReroot1.jpg" width="361"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The consequence of this insertion is that <code>Split.1</code> relies 
		on <code>Split</code>.<code>2</code> and no longer on<code> Extrude.1</code>.</p>
		<p>This is shown in the two following pictures, snapshots of the Parent/Children 
		command:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>After Insertion of Split.2</th>
				<th>Before Insertion of Split.2</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="270" src="images/CAAMmrOGSParentChild1.jpg" width="326"/></td>
				<td>
				<img alt="" height="270" src="images/CAAMmrOGSParentChild2.jpg" width="326"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This dependency modification of <code>Split.1</code> is managed by a 
		mechanism of &quot;<strong>re-root</strong>&quot; in the ordered set. A 
		feature cannot simply be aggregated into an ordered set, it is necessary 
		to invoke a re-root function: <code>Insert</code> method of the<em><strong> 
		CATIMmiUseLinearBodyServices</strong></em> interface. This method must also 
		be invoked if you reorder features inside an ordered set, or if you change 
		the inputs of a surfacic feature (useless for solid features). Before calling 
		this <code>Insert</code> method, the feature must have been updated.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>The Main Input</strong>
		<p>Some modification features can have several input specifications. In 
		this case, one of the absorbed features is privileged. This feature has 
		two roles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It gives the <strong>graphic properties</strong> to the absorbent 
				feature
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<img alt="" height="268" src="images/CAAMmrPart2MainInput1.jpg" width="267"/></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>The color of Feat3, a feature of modification which has two inputs, 
				is given by its main input, here it is Feat2.</p>
			</li>
			<li>In case of <strong>reorder</strong> of a feature of modification, 
				the moved feature has for new input the main input of the previous 
				feature
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<img alt="" height="269" src="images/CAAMmrPart2MainInput2.jpg" width="261"/></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>If Feat4, a feature of modification, is moved before Feat3, the 
				input of Feat4 becomes Feat2, the main input.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>The Result of an Ordered Set</strong>
		<p>Absorbed features do not appear in the result of an ordered set. The
		<code>GetResults</code> method of <strong><em>CATIBodyRequest</em></strong> 
		interface which returns the result of a geometrical features set, does not 
		include the absorbed (unrelevant) features.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>How to get information on absorbed/absorbent features</strong></p>
		<p>The <em><strong>CATIInputDescription</strong></em> interface gives information 
		on features.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>The type</p>
				<p>The method <code><strong>GetFeatureType</strong></code> returns 
				the type of a feature. There are three possible types:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Creation</strong>: the feature creates matter. For 
						example, a Line is a creation feature.</li>
					<li><strong>Modification</strong>: the feature modifies another 
						feature. For example, a Split is a modification feature. 
						Modification features are absorbent features.</li>
					<li><strong>Contextual</strong>: the feature creates matter 
						but is closely associated with a specific feature. For example, 
						an Offset is a contextual creation feature.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Information on the absorbed features of an absorbent feature</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The method <code><strong>GetListOfModifiedFeatures</strong></code> 
						returns the list of absorbed features.</li>
					<li>The method <code><strong>GetMainInput</strong></code> returns 
						the main input.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p>Hybrid Bodies and Ordered Geometrical Sets are ordered sets. They are characterized 
by the order and absorption concepts :</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Order</strong>: a feature in an ordered set can only have input 
		specifications above it in the Specification Tree. The current feature helps 
		manage the positionning of features in the set and simplifies visualization.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Absorption:</strong> features modified by other features become 
		unrevelant. In an ordered set they are neither visualized, neither selectable, 
		they are absorbed by the modification feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended to use the <em><strong>CATFeatureImportAgent</strong></em> 
class in your interactive commands: it ensures the coherence of the specifications 
by enabling the selection of valid features only.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>CATIInputDescription</strong></em> interface gives information 
on features in an ordered Set.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>CATIMmiUseLinearBodyServices</strong></em> interface manages 
the linearity rules in an ordered set, after a modification (aggregation, input 
change, reorder). It must be called after an update of the modified feature.</p>
