<h2><a name="Basic"></a>Basic Objective</h2>
<p> The basic objective of this article is that,user will be able to understand about 
gateways. Integration of X-PDM with the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform is achieved with 
event exchange services. Gateway plays a very important role in exchanging event 
between two PDMs. Overview of this integration is given in <a href="#References">Integration of MyX-PDM with the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform - An Overview[1]</a>. This article gives detail information about two gateways 
involved in this integration.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h2><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Gateways are the dispatchers of events.Those play key role for transferring the 
event from one PDM to other PDM. Gateway receive events via http and dispatch them to their local 
adapters 
or remote controller for processing.</p>
<p>Gateways are connected to PDM through Bus adapter. 
Bus Adapters are responsible for 
processing the event and data associated with it. </p>
<p>This components are explained in <a href="#References">Integration 
Architecture[2]</a>. </p>
<p>Gateway implements the Event Bus, which enables asynchronous bi-directional PLM data exchange between the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform 
and non-DS PDM or ERP systems or X-PDM server(s).
Communication between different systems involves:<ul>
<li>Events conveyed by http protocol.</li>
<li>Files (metadata files in XPDMXML format and bulk data files) conveyed by FTP, SFTP or UNC protocol through a File Server.</li></ul>
<p>While integrating X-PDM with the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform,we require two gateways:<br> 1. <strong>XPDM Gateway</strong> 
-&gt; Located 
on client machine where X-PDM application is running.<br> 2. <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway.
-&gt; Located on Server machine where <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform server is installed.</p>
<p>Event Bus Architecture used in CAA application is explained in following <a href="#Eventbus">Fig.1</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Gateway"></a>XPDM Gateway</h2>
<p> 
XPDM Gateway is present on client Machine. It is dedicated gateway for X-PDM 
which is PDM to be integrated with the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform.</p>
<p> 
Roles of this gateway are :</p>

<ul>
	<li>Receive events from the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE
	Gateway and to 
	make them available for processing to the bus adapter of X-PDM.</li>
	<li>Receive events from the bus store adapter and dispatch them to the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE
	Gateway.</li>
	<li>Manage event state, queues, persistency and error retries.</li>
	<li>Transfer meta and bulk data from/to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE
	Gateway through 
	file transfer protocol(FTP, SFTP or UNC).</li>
	<li>Download/upload these data to/from a directory accessible to the adapter 
	from/to the fileserver.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="V6Gateway"> </a><strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway</h2>
<p> <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE gateway is installed at the server side where <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform is 
installed. It is communicating with X-PDM gateway for exchange of data 
between two PDMs.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h2><a name="Exchange"></a>Event Exchanges at Gateways</h2>
<p>The principle of Events Exchanges is based on firing events from one system 
in direction to another, the source and the target endpoints. The events are transferred via the HTTP protocol between the two Gateways and 
the data associated via file server protocols like (S)FTP or UNC.</p>
<p>Different steps involved during the exchange of data between two PDMs is 
explained in <a href="#References">Integration Architecture[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The events have static parameters like the types of data that need to be 
associated with (Meta data, bulk data or both) as well as the processing 
locations (local, remote or local and remote). These parameters are described in 
a configuration file that is known to both sides of the system. The rest of the 
parameters are described by the application in charge of the event in the form 
of a documentation that explains the content of the data exchanged as well as 
the associated business logic necessary to process the event.</p>
<p>If event is having meta or bulkdata associated with it then this will be 
transferd to adapter for processing. File transfer between gateway and adapter 
is explained in <a href="#References">Bus Adapter[3]</a>.</p>
<p>While processing associated event data, event will be transferred to 
adapter. Processing of event is dependent on the business logic mentioned in bus 
store adapter. Please refer to
<a href="#References">Sample bus Adapter for MyX-PDM[4]</a> for details about 
processing. </p>

<h2><a name="Configure"> </a> Gateway Configuration </h2>
<p> Following parameters need to be considered while configuring gateway :</p>
<h4>SuSupported Events</h4>
<p> When developing an XPDM bus adapter knowing the web service interface 
is very important.</p>
<p> e.g. the xml meta data content associated with an event will be 
specific to it. With each application domain of exchanges comes a set of events 
is defined OOTB with the product. These sets of events will come with documentations that will describe what 
are the parameters of each events as well as a description of the content of the 
XPDMXML file.</p>
<p>The set of supported events is described in an xml file called 
<strong>event-config.xml</strong> w which located in the config\event directory of the 
gateway. A 
bunch of parameters are set in this file like if the event has bulk or/and Meta 
data attached, its processing location, etc...</p>
<p>By default the gateway will be installed with a limited set of events which 
purposes are to use the basic functionality of an adapter. e.g. the event 
XPGTransferFile will only need attached bulk data.</p>
<p>When the gateway will receive an event that is not installed then it will be 
rejected and not delegated to the adapter.Therefore when developing an adapter you should decide which events your 
adapter will support and install them accordingly into the config\event 
directory of the gateway.</p>
<h4>Sites Map</h4>
<p>Sites represent the gateway endpoints of the &quot;Events Exchanges&quot; deployment 
(i.e. the Gateways) .Each site has a unique id and an url.</p>
<p>Each gateway (X-PDM and <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE) has a <strong>site-ids-config.xml</strong> f file in its config path. 
This file describes the sites that will communicate with the gateway as well as 
the &quot;self site&quot; which represent the gateway that owns this config directory.</p>
<p>Since the current focal point of the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Events Exchanges architecture is the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE itself the<strong> site-ids-config.xml </strong>of the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway will list 
every endpoint of 
the deployment. </p>
<p>On the X-PDM gateway side the only sites that will be declared are the &quot;self 
site&quot; as well as the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform site.</p>
<p>Here is an xml example of an X-PDM Gateway site-ids-config.xml:</p>
<pre class="code">   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;SiteMap&gt;
        &lt;!-- the XPDM Gateway &quot;self site&quot; --&gt;
        &lt;Site id=&quot;XPDMGateway&quot; url=&quot;http://XPDMGateway:8001/Gateway&quot; self=&quot;true&quot; /&gt; 
        &lt;!-- the V6 Gateway site --&gt;
        &lt;Site id=&quot;V6Gateway&quot; url=&quot;http://V6Gateway:8080/Gateway&quot; self=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/SiteMap&gt;</pre>
<p> 

<strong>Warning</strong>: : The site ids must refer to the same 
endpoints on all the sites of the Event Bus deployment. i.e. for the previous 
example, the configured site id of the XPDM Side Gateway on the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway must 
also be <code>XPDMGateway</code>.
