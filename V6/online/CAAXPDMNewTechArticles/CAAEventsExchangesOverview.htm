<h2><a name="About"></a>About Events Exchanges</h2>
<p>The principle of Events Exchanges is based on firing events from one 
system in direction to another, the source and the target endpoints. </p>
<p>The events have static parameters like the types of data that need to be 
associated with (Meta data, bulk data or both) as well as the processing 
locations (local, remote or local and remote). These parameters are described in 
a configuration file that is known to both sides of the system. The rest of the 
parameters are described by the application in charge of the event in the form 
of a documentation that explains the content of the data exchanged as well as 
the associated business logic necessary to process the event.</p>
<p>The events are transferred via the HTTP protocol between the two Gateways and 
the data associated via file server protocols like (S)FTP or UNC.</p>
<p>The illustration describes the architecture of the Event Bus, the blue 
parts are provided out of the box by Dassault Systemes, the purple ones by a 
partner and the xPDM vendor.</p>
<p>The rest of this document will be dedicated to the events web services and their expected uses by the Adapter.</p>

<p>On the xPDM side the main two components of the event exchanges are:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>The Gateway whose role is to:</dt>
	<dd>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Receive events from the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway and to make them available 
			for processing to the Adapter</li>
	        <li>Receive events from the Adapter and dispatch them to the 
			<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway</li>
	        <li>Manage event state, queues, persistency and error retries</li>
	        <li>Transfer meta and bulk data from/to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway through file 
			transfer protocol</li>
	        <li>Download/upload these data to/from a directory accessible to the 
			Adapter from/to the fileserver</li>		    
	    </ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>The Adapter whose role is to:</dt>
	<dd>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Send event to the Gateway in direction of the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway</li>
	        <li>Poll and process events</li>
	        <li>Prepare meta and bulk data when necessary</li>
	    </ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>This rest of this document will explains how to use the Event Bus's Event 
Services to develop an Adapter that will comply to these three roles.</p>

<h2><a name="FactsOnProcessing"></a>Facts about Processing</h2>

<h3><a name="RetrievingEventstoProcess"></a>Retrieving Events to Process</h3>
<p>When the Gateway receive events either from the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway, or its Adapter, it will guess if they need processing on the xPDM side. 
If this is the case these events will be put into a special queue that will make them retrievable by the Adapter so it can process them.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Adapter to periodically retrieve events from 
this queue to process them.</p>  
<p>The events are retrieved by polling the <code>GetNextEventsForProcessing</code> 
method. The end of the processing must be signaled by calling the <code>
SendEventProcessingFeedback</code> method.</p>

<h3><a name="TimeOut"></a>Processing Time Out</h3>
<p>Once the events have been retrieved from the Gateway a processing time out is 
set to avoid having zombies events if the Adapter has failed or did not send the 
feedback properly.</p>
<p>The time out value is configured in the Gateway config file, and the time 
left to process each event is given to the Adapter in the <code>
GetNextEventsForProcessing</code> method.</p>
<p>If the processing of an event is going to take more time than allowed, then 
the Adapter is able to reset the timer at anytime by sending a feedback process 
of value <code>STILL_PROCESSING</code> (with the <code>
SendEventProcessingFeedback</code> method).</p>

<h3><a name="ProcessingLocation"></a>Processing Location</h3>
<p>Each event has a "Processing Location" parameter which could have three values : <code>LocalOnly</code>, <code>RemoteOnly</code> or <code>LocalRemote</code>.</p>
<p><code>LocalOnly</code> means that this event will only need processing on the site that fired it (the local site). It will be delegated to the Adapter but not sent to the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE site.
<br><code>RemoteOnly</code> means that this event will only need processing on the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE site. It will not be delegated to the Adapter and will directly be sent to the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE site.
<br><code>LocalRemote</code> means that this event will need processing by the two sites. It will be delegated to the Adapter and will be sent to the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE site after successful processing.
</p>
<p>What we call "Local Event" in the following text is an event that was fired by Adapter. A "Remote Event" is an event that was received by the Gateway from the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE site.</p>

<h2><a name="LocalEventsSendingAndProcessing"></a>Sending and Processing Local 
Events</h2>

<p>Before sending an event the Adapter needs to determine the target and source 
site ids as well as the name of the supported events using respectively <code>
GetListOfSites</code> and <code>GetListOfSupportedEvents</code>. The source site 
must be the local site and the target site the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE site. The <code>GetListOfSupportedEvents</code> output list will 
contain all the static parameters associated with the events (processing 
location, type of associated data ...) as they are defined into the Gateway 
configuration file.</p>
<p>The next steps will differ depending on the processing location.</p>
<p>If the events has a <code>RemoteOnly</code> processing location then the Adapter will not 
need to process this event and can directly send it using <code>SendEvent</code>. On the contrary if the event has a <code>LocalOnly</code> or <code>LocalRemote</code> processing location then the Adapter 
will have to process data.<br>
The Adapter has the choice of when the processing takes place: before or after 
sending the event to the local Gateway.</p>

<p>The two cases are described below:</p>

    <h3><a name="ProcessingBefore"></a>Processing local events before sending 
	them to the Gateway</h3>
        
        <p>The following text refers to (with the bold numbers) and explains the <a href="#Fig.2">
		Fig.2</a>.</p>

        <p>A new <code>AttachmentContentType</code> object must be created with 
		the method <code>GenerateNewAttachmentContent</code> that will we be 
		filled with a unique event path. The Adapter must now process and 
		generate the data needed for this event. (<strong>1</strong> and <strong>
		2</strong>)
        <br>Depending of the associated file type there are two ways of sending 
		the Meta data file.</p>
        <p>If the events only require Meta data and if this file size is small 
		then it can be directly sent to the Gateway without any file transfer by 
		adding the content of this file as a <code>string</code> inside the <code>
		inline</code> choice of the <code>xpgxml</code> element of the <code>
		iLocallyProcessedEventContent</code> input parameter (<strong>4</strong>).</p>
        <p>If the event also requires bulk data files or if the xml file size 
		is too big then it must be firstly stored into the event path and 
		secondly referenced inside the <code>fileReference</code> choice of the <code>
		xpgxml</code> element of the <code>iLocallyProcessedEventContent</code> 
		input parameter (<strong>3</strong>). 
        <br>Similarly, the bulk data files must be stored into the event path 
		then referenced into the <code>bulkDatareferences</code> element of the <code>
		iLocallyProcessedEventContent</code> input parameter(<strong>3</strong>)</p>
        <p>By setting the <code>iLocallyProcessedEventContent</code> parameter 
		the Gateway will recogniz the fact that this event has already been 
		locally processed thus will directly send it to the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway alongside 
		the associated data.</p>
        <p>The last step is to effectively call <code>SendEvent</code> (<strong>4</strong>) 
		with all the previously determined parameters : target site id, event
		name, processed file reference, etc...</p>

    <h3><a name="ProcessingAfter"></a>Processing local events after sending them 
	to the Gateway</h3>
    
            <p>The following text refers to (with the bold numbers) and explains 
			the <a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The main benefits of processing the events after sending it is to 
			be able to quickly send event that would need a significant time of 
			processing without blocking any other process (UI ...), therefore 
			the Gateway will add it in its queues and the processing order 
			will be respected.</p>

    
            <p><b>Step 1 : Sending the event</b></p>

            <p>The event can be sent to the Gateway from anywhere (Client, 
			directly the Adapter ... - <strong>1</strong>) and will later be 
			delegated for processing on the Adapter (Step 2).
            <br>When sending the event, useful parameters necessary for later processing can be 
			stored in to the<code> iProcessingArgs</code> element of the <code>SendEvent</code> 
			method.</p>
            <p>After the event has been sent to the Gateway it will be made 
			available for processing to the Adapter.</p>
            
            <p><b>Step 2 : Processing the event</b></p>

            <p>The event will be retrieved via the <code>
			GetNextEventsForProcessing</code> method (<strong>2</strong>) along 
			with its parameters (event name, id, processing args, queue type 
			...). To know that the event comes from the local site the Adapter must check its <code>queueType</code> element that will have the value <code>LOCAL</code>.
			<br>From the other parameters the Adapter can decide and apply the 
			needed business logic to generate the events associated files. (<strong>3</strong>)</p>
            <p>If the event need processing on the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE site (.i.e if the Processing location is <code>LocalRemote</code> : see <a href="#ProcessingLocation">Processing Location</a>) the resulting files must be stored into the event path (<strong>4</strong>) as well as referenced 
            into the <code>iProcessedAttachmentContent</code> element of the <code>SendEventProcessingFeedback</code> method.</p>  

            <p>In all cases a processing feedback must be sent to the Gateway (<strong>5</strong>).</p>

<h2><a name="RemoteEventsProcessing"></a>Processing Remote Events</h2>

    <p>The following text refers to (with the bold numbers) and explains the <a href="#Fig.4">
	Fig.4</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Like with for a local event, the remote events in need of processing will 
	be retrieved via the <code>GetNextEventsForProcessing</code> method (<strong>1</strong>). 
	To know that an event is Remote the Adapter has to check the <code>
	queueType</code> element of the <code>EventForProcessing</code> which value 
	will be <code>REMOTE</code>.</p>
	<p>From the supported event name the Adapter can know if meta and bulk data 
	are associated with this type of event. If it's the case they will be 
	referenced into the <code>attachmentContent</code> element of the <code>
	EventForProcessing</code> which will allow the Adapter to fetch them from 
	the event path (<strong>2</strong>) before applying the corresponding 
	business logic (<strong>3</strong>).</p>
	<p>Finally according to the result (error, success) of the processing the 
	Adapter must send a processing feedback to the Gateway using the <code>
	SendEventProcessingFeedback</code> method (<strong>4</strong>).</p>
