<h2> <a name="Basic"></a>Basic Objective</h2>
<p> This article gives detailed information about sample bus adapter 
which is dedicated for executing CAA usecases. From this illustration, user will 
understand about role of an adapter in exchanging the data and how to create his 
own adapter in any application.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h2> <a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>



<p>While exchanging data between two PDMs ,we are using two adapters:<br><strong> 1. V6 Gateway Adapters </strong>: 
This adapters need to be present at <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE side. This will be 
managed by <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform itself. <br> <strong>2. MyX-PDM Sample bus adapter</strong> : 
This bus adapter is present at MyX-PDM side. This adapter 
need to be managed by user of MyX-PDM.</p>
<p>Here it is important to understand that user can create their own adapter to 
exchange the event between MyX-PDM and <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform.</p>

<p> Sample bus adapter for MyX-PDM provides the link between MyX-PDM gateway and 
MyX-PDM server(PDM server). We have designed an application&nbsp;which is 
integrated with different 
functionalities related to PDM. Refer to <a href="#References">MyX-PDM 
Application[1]</a> for details about this application.</p>
<p> Following <a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a> explains the architecture of CAA 
integration.</p>

<h2> <a name="Sample"></a>Sample Bus Adapter for MyX-PDM</h2>
<p>MyX-CAD application supports two types of data creation. We can create 
Component of <code>.CAACmp </code> and Assembly of <code>.CAAAsm</code> formats 
in MyX-CAD application. Creation of these data is explained in
<a href="#References">How to Use MyX-CAD data Type [2]</a>. </p>
<p>We can convert MyX-CAD application data into xml file format 
i.e. XPDMXML using bus adapter. Sample Bus adapter contains the implementation 
of converting CAA Sample data into XPDMXML File. Details about this 
implementation is given in <a href="#References">XPDMXML for Basic Data Type[3]</a> and 
<a href="#References">XPDMXML for Assembly Data Type[4]</a>.</p>


<p> Sample Bus adapter contains the implementation of events bus services. 
Synchronous Communication between MyX-PDM gateway and <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE gateway is achieved 
with event bus services.</p>
<p> 

This implementation is given in <a href="#References">Send Sample to 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform[5]</a> and <a href="#References">Processing of Remote Events[6]</a> usecases.</p>
<p> 

Sample bus adapter also contains the implementation of monitoring web services which 
are used for monitoring the gateway operation. This implementation is given in
<a href="#References">Gateway Monitoring services[7]</a>.</p>

<h2> <a name="Processing"></a>How Events are processed with MyX-PDM Adapter?</h2>
<p> MyX-CAD application provides the user interface for MyX-PDM functionalities. 
User can trigger the commands for exchanging the data between MyX-PDM and 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform. How to use this application and triger operations is explained in
<a href="#References">MyX-PDM application[1]</a>.
</p>
<p> MyX-PDM Adapter supports two types of processing depending on the type of 
event :</p>
<h4> Processing of Local Events : </h4>

<p><a href="#Fig.2">[Fig.2]</a> shows how local events are processed at MyX-PDM 
Adapter. This processing involves sequential processes when 
user invokes &quot;<strong>Send to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform</strong>&quot; command.Following is 
the explanation about each step shown in <a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>:</p>

<table>
			<caption><a name="Fig.2"></a>Fig.2 Processing of Event at MyX-PDM</caption>
			<tr>
			<td><img src="images/CAAXPDMSampleBusXPDMAdapter.Fig.2.jpg"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

<ol> 
<li>When user invokes command &quot;<strong>Send Sample to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform</strong>&quot;, control of MyX-CAD 
application will be transfered to MyX-PDM adapter.This is explained by <strong>(1)</strong> 
operation.</li>

<li>Adapter process and generates the data needed for event for i.e. XPDMXML 
is generated along with the meta data. An object filled with unique event path will 
be generated.This is explained by <strong>(2)</strong> 
process.</li>
</ol>
<p> Depending 
on the associated file type there are two ways of sending Meta Data file.</p>
<ol> 
<li value="3"> If the event requires bulk data files or if the XPDMXML file size 
is too big then it must be firstly stored into the event path i.e. copied to 
shadow directory and secondly referenced inside input parameter.This is 
explained by <strong>(3) </strong>operation.</li>
<li> If 
the events only require Meta data and if this file size is small then it can be 
directly sent to the Gateway without any file transfer by adding the content of 
this file as a <code>string</code> 
input parameter.This is explained by <strong>(4)</strong> operation.</li>
<li>The last step is to effectively call <strong>Send</strong> with all the 
determined parameters (e.g.target site id and event name etc). Event will 
proceed towards the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway for the processing. 
This is represented with <strong>(5)</strong> operation. When this event will be 
sent to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE gateway it's processing will be handled by V6 adapters. </li>
Depending on the processing at V6 adapter, X-PDM gateway receives the 
feedback and notifies to user about this.</ol>

<h4> Processing of Remote Events :</h4>

<p><a href="#Fig.3">[Fig.3]</a> shows how remote events are processed at MyX-PDM 
Adapter. This processing involves sequential processes happening in execution of 
&quot;<strong>Processing of Remote Events</strong>&quot; 
usecase . Following is 
the explanation about each step shown in <a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a>:</p>
<table>
			<caption><a name="Fig.3"></a>Fig.3 Processing of Remote Event at MyX-PDM</caption>
			<tr>
			<td><img src="images/CAAXPDMSampleBusXPDMAdapter.Fig.3.jpg"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

<ol> 
<li>Any V6 command or Batch&nbsp; invokes &quot;<strong>Send to X-PDM</strong>&quot; 
command. After completing local processing,<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE gateway sends an event to X-PDM 
gateway for remote processing.This is explained by <strong>(1)</strong>. Events 
that required processing at XPDM will be in waiting state.</li>
<li>Sample bus adapter will make a call to X-PDM gateway and checks for events 
that require processing at X-PDM.This is explained by <strong>(2)</strong> 
operation.</li>
<li>Sample bus adapter polls event from X-PDM gateway.It also 
retrieves the necessary information about processing from event. Supported event 
name gives the details about meta and bulk data that are associated with this type of 
event. This is explained by <strong>(3)</strong> operation.</li>
<li>If meta or bulkdata is associated with the event then sample bus adapter 
fetch them from the event path <strong>(4)</strong> and copy it into local shadow 
directory.</li>
<li>Sample bus adapter processes this event and data depending on the business 
logic mentioned by customer<strong>(5)</strong>. Bus Adapter notifies to user 
about this processing status<strong>(6)</strong>.</li>
<li>Feedback of this processing i.e. Processing result or return code will be sent to X-PDM 
Gateway<strong>(7)</strong>. </li>
<li>X-PDM gateway transfer this processing feedback to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE gateway<strong>(8)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
