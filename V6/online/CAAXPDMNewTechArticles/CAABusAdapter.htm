<h2> <a name="Basic"></a>Basic Objective</h2>
<p> The basic objective of this article is that,user will be able to understand 
about different adapters used in event exchange.This article deals with the role 
of an adapter in exchanging the data and how to create store adapter in any 
application. </p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h2> <a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>



<p>Adapters are the links between gateway and PDM servers. Events which are 
received at gateways will be processed at adapters. It retrieve the events 
from local controllers,fetch and processes the associated data accordingly to the 
event types and documentation. Adapters are also responsible for sending the 
events to their controller.</p>
<p>In this way,we consider adapter as the indirect link between the two PDM 
system.We can transfer and access the data between the two PDM system over the 
http protocol. Adapter know that how to handle the event which is going/coming 
from the adapter. Main function of adapter is to make outgoing event compatible 
with the other PDM and read incoming event. </p>
<p>While exchanging data between xPDM and <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform, two adapters are used:<br><strong> 
1. V6 Adapters </strong>: This adapters are present at <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform 
side.This will be managed by <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform itself. <br> <strong>
2. X-PDM bus adapter i.e. Store Adapter</strong> : This bus adapter is present at X-PDM  This adapter need to be managed by customer who uses X-PDM.</p>
<p>Here it is important to understand that user can create their own adapter to 
send the Event from PDM application to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<p>Adapters are responsible for processing of data associated with events.This 
processing steps makes changes in PDM objects so that those will be understand 
by another PDM.</p>
<p>Data exchange between <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform and X-PDM is based on Event exchange 
mechanism.In this mechanism, one system fires event in a direction to other 
system. These system will be treated as source and target endpoints. Overview of 
this integration is given in <a href="#References">Integration of X-PDM with the 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform -An Overview [1]</a>.</p>
<p> Here, X-PDM bus adapter i.e. Store adapter is used to convert data created through any application to the metadata file.
 This conversion is required in transferring CAD data to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform which is stored in X-PDM.
 So that data will be understood by <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform. and any other V6 application can use this data.
 </p> 
 <p>For communication between two sytems,event web services are used by X-PDM 
gateway.These services need to be implemented in store adapter. Please refer to 
	<a href="#References">Sample Bus adapter for MyX-PDM [2]</a> for details.</p>

<h2> <a name="Role"></a>Roles of Bus Adapter</h2>
<p>Main roles of XPDM bus adapter are: </p>
<ul><li>Send event to the X-PDM gateway in direction of <strong><strong>3D</strong></strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Gateway</li>
<li>Poll and process events received from <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Gateway</li>
<li>Prepare meta data and bulk data when necessary</li>
<li>Convert the CAD data into xml file format(XPDMXML) and send it towards the 
X-PDM gateway along with the meta data.</li>
</ul>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h2> <a name="WHY"></a>WHY to use Bus Adapter?</h2>
<p>X-Apps application supports different types of data creation.These types of 
data format are not known to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform.While sending such data,this 
format should be well understood. </p>
<p>For this purpose,converting this data in a format which will be known to 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform
is very important. We can convert X-Apps application data into xml file format 
i.e. XPDMXML using bus adapter.Bus adapter prepares event to send this 
information towards other PDM i.e. <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE&nbsp; Platform over http protocols.</p>

<h2> <a name="WHERE"></a>Where to use Bus Adapter?</h2>
<p>Adapter is used between the PDM server and the Gateway. Here PDM server is named as X-PDM. So we named gateway as X-PDM gateway(dedicated for X-PDM server )[<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>].</p>

		<p>Please refer to <a href="#References">Integration Architecture [3]</a> 
		to know about every component used in this integration.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h2> <a name="FTP"></a>File Transfer between Adapter and Gateway</h2>
<p>Adapters are dedicated for processing data associated with events.Depending 
on processing time(After or before) and event processing locations the adapter 
may have to fetch and store associated files into the event path.</p>
<p>There is no out of the box solution to transfer data between the Adapter and 
Gateway yet.Therefore it is the responsibility of the adapter to have a way to 
fetch and store data in the Shadow directory. </p>
<p>One possible solution is to have the Shadow directory shared between the 
Adapter and Gateway machines.It is also the responsibility of the Adapter to 
create the event path in the Shadow directory if it doesn't yet exist.</p>
<p>Shadow directory is any directory which is shared between gateway and adapter 
and both of them have information of this sharing. Generally,we treat shadow 
folder which is present in gateway installation directory i.e.
<strong>$GatewayInstallation$\Shadow </strong> as Shadow directory.</p>

<h2> <a name="Inshort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p> This article gives detailed information about the bus adapter for X-PDM. 
User will understand the role of adapter involved in data exchange between 
different PDMs. This article also describes about some important steps in 
creating a new bus adapter while creating a new application.</p>
