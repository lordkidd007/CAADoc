<h2><a name="Why"></a>WHY Integrate X-PDM with <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform ?</h2>
<p>PLM and PDM systems are highly flexible and complex systems that companies configure to meet their existing business process needs. 
 Companies need an interface between these systems that is fast, efficient and flexible enough to meet the needs of both systems. 
</p>
<p>Adapter for X-PDM brings additional exchange scenarios to meet these challenges.
</p>
<p> Adapter for X-PDM aims at supporting the following processes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>When some of the design is performed in a non-DS system and must be integrated in an Engineering structure. 
	</li>
	<li>When the design authored in <strong class="style1">3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform must be propagated to a non-DS system that manages product release or downstream processes.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="How"></a>HOW does X-PDM allow data co-operation with the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE 
Platform ?</h2>
<p>To integrate X-PDM with the <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform we are using event exchange services via 
Adapter. Adapters provide the link between PDM servers and Gateways. It 
retrieves event data,fetch it and processes it as mentioned in event types and 
documentation.It also sends the event to their controller. This processing step 
makes the necessary changes to the PDM objects so that it can be understand by 
<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform.</p>
<p>For details about adapter refer to
<a href="#References">
Bus Adapter [1]</a>.</p>
<p>Web services are used to exchange the events between&nbsp;V6 gateway and X-PDM 
gateway. X-PDM event exchange is based on XPG events services.</p>

<h2><a name="Components"></a>WHAT are the Components of X-PDM Integration?</h2>
<p>X-PDM integration consists of component depicted below [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>]:</p>

<p><strong>Store Adapter</strong> plays a very important role in achieving this 
integration. Adapters provides the link between the PDM server and Gateway. </p>
<p>These are responsible for processing the data associated with events which&nbsp; 
are received at gateway. These processes can make changes to PDM objects. Adapter 
can send events to their local controllers. </p>
<p>In 
this way,adapter provides the indirect link between two PDM systems.Role of adapter is to make outgoing event compatible with other PDM and read incoming events.</p>
<p>Customer have to create their own adapter for their application.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h2><a name="capable"> </a>Capabilities Scope</h2>
<p>Basic objective of this integration is to provide capabilities for exchanging the data between two PDM 
systems :</p>
<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Import - </strong></em> Send the data from X-PDM to <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Export -&nbsp; </strong></em>Receive and Process the data in X-PDM, sent thourgh 
	<strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two scenarios have been documented through usecase. Usecase illustrates 
the steps involved in realizing these operations. </p>
<p>Along with these scenarios,some other operations for retrieving the gateway 
configuration information are documented through different usecases.</p>
<p>Web services operations dedicated for gateway monitoring operations are also 
documented through dedicated usecases.</p>

<p>The article deals with basics of X-PDM and how it is integrated with <strong>3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Platform.Any 
application can provide the user interface to perform different operations with 
X-PDM.Bus Adapter completes the action required and notifies customer about status 
of processing.</p>
