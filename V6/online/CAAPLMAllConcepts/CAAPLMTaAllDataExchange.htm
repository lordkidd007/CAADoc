<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>In DS PLM products, data is stored in <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a>. 
Users can work concurrently inside a <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a> 
to create, browse and modify data. But it is also frequently needed to share 
data across <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repositories</a> in 
order to enable concurrent engineering on a wider scale, as described in the 
following chart:</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="images/DataExchangeAbstract.jpg" width="706" height="290"></p>
		<p>For example, <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repositories</a> 
		need to communicate with each other in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between&nbsp;geographical sites of the same company.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between different companies: an OEM and its suppliers, 
	a manufacturer 
and its clients.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between a catalog issuer and all companies using 
	the catalog parts.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between PLM Workgroups.</li>
</ul>
		<p>Data Exchange is the capability to transfer data between <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repositories</a>, 
		or between a <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a> 
		and an external system. </p>
<p>Dassault Systems proposes complementary solutions to handle this requirement:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PLM Briefcase</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PLM Replication</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3DXML</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutral Formats</li>
</ul>
<p>This article 
gives an overview of those solutions and their respective features.</p>
<p><b>Please note </b>that there are no CAA 
		APIs exposed for data exchange. Data Exchange is available only through 
		interactive commands. </p>
		<h2><a name="Part1"></a>Data Exchange Solutions Overview</h2>
<p>PLM Data Exchange is the process to extract/transport/import PLM data 
from one <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a> to 
another. All solutions described below are based on the generation of exchangeable files 
of various formats. They all follow the following macro-steps.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Export step</b>: Extract a selection of data from a 
repository, and generate exchange files. Various processing might happen here (filtering, 
conversion, simplification...).</li>
	<li><b>Import step</b>: Integrate the content of an exchange 
file in the receiving repository. Various processing might happen here 
(conversion, links reroute, update...).</li>
	<li><b>Transport step</b>: Transport the exchange files from 
the physical location where they were generated to the physical location(s) were 
they need to be imported. </li>
</ul>
<p>The transport step is not described in this article, as Dassault Systems does 
not intend to provide any specific middleware solution.</p>
<h3><b><a name="PLMReplication"></a>PLM Replication</b></h3>
<p>PLM Replication is a DS solution for distributed PLM authoring over distant 
geographical sites. It enables multiple  
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM 
repositories </a>to share the same 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a> and to be regularly synchronized with each other. It supports co-design 
scenarios where each site contributes to a common design. Note that this 
solution could be used inside a single company that wants to dispatch the design 
work on multiple geographical sites, or between multiple companies that agreed 
to share the same PLM system and same work methodology.</p>
<h3><b><a name="PLMBriefcase"></a>PLM Briefcase 
</b></h3>
<p>PLM Briefcase is a Dassault Systems' file format for lossless transport of PLM data from one 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM 
repository</a> to another. Using PLM Briefcase, users can easily copy <span lang="en-us">
	<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a></span> from one&nbsp;<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a> to another. It supports simple carry-over scenarios, 
where one user creates a new design by duplicating an existing one.</p>
<h3><b><a name="3DXML"></a>3DXML </b></h3>
<p>3DXML is a universal, lighweight XML-based format proposed by Dassault Systems. 
It is meant to become the preferred format for mass market diffusion of 3D data, and integration with other 
companies' systems. 3DXML can be previewed with standalone DS tools (3DXML 
Viewer an Internet Explorer Plug-In) and it can be embedded in Microsoft Office 
documents. Refer to Dassault-Systems' presentation of 3DXML on
www.3DS.com. 3DXML enables Data Exchange as it can be imported in a <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a> for clash analysis, digital 
mock-up or as a working context for supplier.</p>
<h3><b><a name="NeutralFormats"></a>&nbsp;Neutral Formats </b></h3>
<p>Neutral formats are industry standards for Engineering Data Exchange. Some of 
those standards are supported 
by PLM products, for examples: Step AP203, Step AP214, IGES. Thus, it is 
possible to export a CATIA session to one of those formats, or import a neutral 
format file into a CATIA session. Neutral formats enable data 
exchange data between PLM repositories and external systems.</p>

<p><span lang="en-us">Below we give explanations concerning the features of the different solutions 
above.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en-us">&nbsp;<b><a name="Format"></a>Format</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">This section describes the file format produced by each solution. One major 
difference between those formats is that some are open standards, while others are 
proprietary to Dassault Systems. </span> </p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><a href="#PLMReplication">PLM Replication</a> generates multiple files, 
	including a proprietary XML-formatted file describing the
	<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a> and a 
	set of raw binary files extracted from the vault. Those files are not 
	visible to the end-user, since they are meant to be generated and 
	transported through automatic batch processes.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><a href="#PLMBriefcase">PLM Briefcase</a> uses a proprietary format with 
	&quot;PLMBriefcase&quot; extension. This is a binary transport format whose content 
	can not be browsed or modified. It includes a header section describing the 
	content of the briefcase. </span> </li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><a href="#3DXML">3DXML</a> is an open XML format, associated with cgr 
	geometry files. All files are embedded in a single zip archive with &quot;.3DXML&quot; 
	extension. The XML-formatted data is documented an public. It can be 
	generated, browsed or modified by any-one. 3DXML also supports private XML 
	sections that can be accessed only with a dedicated license. </span> </li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><a href="#NeutralFormats">Neutral Formats</a> generated by DS products 
	comply to industry standards. Refer to the official documentation of Step 
	AP203, Step AP214 and IGES. </span> </li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">This section describes the systems supported by each technology.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>PLM Products</b>: Compatible with &quot;DS PLM Products&quot; 
	means that the technology can be used only between PLM systems provided by 
	Dassault Systems. All 
	Phase 2 PLM products are supported, but this technology can not be used with 
	legacy Phase1 Products or systems from other companies. 
</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>All compliant systems</b>: Compatible with &quot;All 
	compliant systems&quot; means that the technology uses an open standard that can 
	be supported by arbitrary products, provided by Dassault System or another 
	company. Included compliant systems are all Phase 2 PLM products and Phase 1 
	legacy DS products.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-us">Also note that for <a href="#PLMBriefcase">PLM Briefcase</a> and <a href="#PLMReplication">PLM Replication</a>, the two communicating PLM 
systems must share 
the same customization and 
the same release level.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="Scalability"></a>Scalability</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">This section compares the data-exchange technologies based 
on their capability to handles high volume of data. We distinguished 3 levels of 
scalability:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>CAD session</b>: This means that the technology is 
	limited to the amount of data that can hold a CAD session. This is the case 
	for the&nbsp; <a href="#NeutralFormats">Neutral Formats</a> that can only be 
	exported and imported through a CAD session. </span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Full Model</b>: This means that the technology 
	can handle volumes of data that exceed the CAD session memory limit. Those 
	technologies are adapted for exchanging medium-sized models (below 10.000 
	PLM components). Hence <a href="#PLMBriefcase">PLM Briefcase</a> and <a href="#3DXML">3DXML</a> 
	have low memory requirements because they transfer data directly between the 
	repository and the exchange file. They both use data compression to generate 
	smaller files. They are limited by the maximum size of the transport file (for 
	example 2GB 
	for PLMBriefcase).</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Full Repository</b>: This means that the 
	technology is designed for handling up to the full content of a repository. 
	PLM Replication can efficiently synchronize the full content of a repository 
	by using a &quot;delta&quot; exchange mode ( only modified parts of PLM entities are 
	transported ).</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="sharing strategy"></a>Sharing Strategy</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">This section compares the way  
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a> are handled 
when imported in a repository. We distinguish two main sharing modes:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Duplicate</b>: This means that the 
	technology duplicates 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a> at import. 
	For <a href="#PLMBriefcase">PLM Briefcase</a>, <a href="#NeutralFormats">
	Neutral Formats</a> and <a href="#3DXML">3DXML</a>, the import operation 
	creates new <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a>. 
	Those new components have their own PLM Identificator, 
	which is independent from the original exported components'
	PLM Identificator. Consequently, the imported 
	data and the original data can be modified independently. Data can be imported multiple times 
	in the same&nbsp; <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a>, 
	which will generate as many independent data sets. </span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Replicate</b>: This means that the technology 
	replicates 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a> at import. 
	Using <a href="#PLMReplication">PLM Replication</a>, the import operation 
	does not create new PLM components, but creates a view of the same component. All replicates of the same original component share the same PLM Identificator. 
To avoid conflicts, an &quot;Site Ownership&quot; mechanism guarantees that only one of the <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repositories</a> is given the 
	right to modify a given PLM component. The Site Ownership associated to a PLM entity 
can be transferred from one <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a> to another.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="Exchanged Information"></a>Exchanged Information</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">This section describes the type of data that each 
technology is able to transport.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Full PLM description</b>:&nbsp;This means that the 
	technology is able to transport the full description of each 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a> of the 
	model. This description includes
	<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM attributes</a>, 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM extensions</a> ,
	<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">Semantic Relations</a> and 
	Stream-Descriptors. In particular, PLM Briefcase and PLM Replication enable the 
	lossless transport of a 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM component</a>, with 
	complete specification and relational information.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Product Structure and 
		Geometry</b>: This means that the technology is only capable of 
	exporting the Product (or Process) Structure and the 3D geometry 
	information. Consequently,&nbsp; the specification information can not be 
	exchanged using <a href="#NeutralFormats">Neutral Formats</a> and <a href="#3DXML">3DXML.</a> 
	Some <a href="#NeutralFormats">Neutral Formats</a> provide a partial support 
	of relation information.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="Process"></a>Process</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">This section compares how each technology can be used by 
the end-users:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Admin Batch</b>: Export and Import operations are 
operated through batch under the control of an administrator. For <a href="#PLMReplication">PLM Replication</a>, those batches can be configured by declaring distant 
repositories and defining persistent objects (called Replication Packages) that 
	describe the set of 
<a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#(PLM)_Component_">PLM components</a> to be 
	exported.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Export/Import from session</b>: This means that Export/Import are 
	interactive commands available to any user in the CAD session. Export 
	requires loading data into the CAD session before exporting its content. 
	Import loads data into a CAD session, that must be saved for to persist the 
	imported data in the <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Export/Import from repository</b>: This means that Export/Import 
	are interactive commands available to any user in VPMNav. The user defines 
	the data set to be exported through queries and 3DLive navigation within the <a href="CAAPLMAllGlossary.htm#Repository_">PLM Repository</a>.&nbsp; 
	For example, no CAD session is needed for exporting/importing <a href="#3DXML">3DXML</a> 
	and <a href="#PLMBriefcase">PLM Briefcase</a> files since data is transferred directly between the repository and 
the data exchange file.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="Downstream Usage"></a>Downstream Usage</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">This section describes the scenarios that are targeted by 
each technology. </span> </p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Collaborative Authoring</b>: Means that the 
	technology supports concurrent engineering on a shared model across multiple 
	PLM Repositories (also called virtual co-location because users work as if 
	they were connected to a single PLM repository). All PLM authoring 
	applications are supported.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Carry-Over</b>: Means that the technology enables 
	the lossless cloning of data over multiple repositories. This makes it 
	possible to punctually integrate another company's design, or start a new 
	project from an existing design. It does not fit cases where 
	responsabilities are intricated or where long term collaborative work 
	requires frequent updates.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-us"><b>Browse/DMU/Preview</b><u>:</u> Means that the technology 
	can be used to enable 3D navigation, Clash analysis and Digital Mock-up over 
	a distant site. Exported data can also be used as a read-only working 
	context for a supplier. </span></li>
