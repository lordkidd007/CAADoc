		<h2>Installing the Files</h2>
		<p>This section describes how to perform an installation in TUI 
		mode.</p>
		<p>In this mode, the machine does not need a graphics card. The 
		installer prompts you to answer questions in text mode.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>Log on as an administrator.</p>
			<p>You must belong to the Administrators group, or have the privileges 
			assigned to the Administrators group. Otherwise, you will not be able 
			to start the installation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Open a <kbd>Command Prompt</kbd> window.</p>
				<p>The command must be launched from an elevated command prompt 
				from Windows Vista onwards.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Go to the folder to which you unloaded the run time media.</p>
				
				<p>This folder is by default C:\Program Files\Dassault Systemes\B417 as proposed  
by the installation procedure.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Insert the API CD-ROM into the drive.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Launch the installation by running StartTUI.exe from the API 
				CD-ROM, mapped for example on the Z: drive. </p>
<!--
				<p>Depending on whether the
				DS Installer 
				is embedded or not in your app, the procedure differs. If the
				DS Installer 
				is embedded, the installation proceeds as normal. If not, you 
				will be prompted to specify the <code>Installer_Dir</code> directory.</p>
				<p>In that case, launch the installation with the
				<code>-installerPath</code> parameter which 
				specifies the <code>Installer_Dir</code> 
				directory as follows:</p>
				<pre class="codeblock">StartTUI.exe -installerPath C:\Soft\DS_Installer.Windows64</pre>
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also run the following command, in 
				order to display the same dialog box as the one displayed using 
				the GUI mode, prompting you to specify the
				<code>DS_Installer_Dir</code> folder:</p>
				<pre class="codeblock">StartTUI.exe -UI</pre>
				<p>Select the correct <code>DS_Installer_Dir</code> 
				folder in exactly the same way as in GUI mode, then click
				<kbd>OK</kbd> to continue.</p>
-->
				<p>Text output like the following text is displayed, for 
				example:</p>
				<pre class="codeblock" style="left: 0px; top: 0px">C:\Program Files\Dassault Systemes\B417&gt;Z:CAA_NativeApps_3DEXP.Windows64\1\StartTUI.exe

				<p>If you want to have an entry beginning with a &quot;!&quot; which is

				example, if the question is to enter a password, and if your 
				password is <code>!toto</code>, you must write
				<code>!!toto</code>. And if you want to enter
				<code>!!toto</code>, you must write
				<code>!!!toto</code> (and so on).</p>
				<p>If you write a unauthorized command (for example <code>!z</code> ), the following error message

Enter to continue.</pre>
				
				<p>This is how to fill in check boxes and radio buttons.</p>
				<p>Some, all or none of the check boxes can be selected. For

				<p>Radio buttons are identified by <code>( )</code>:</p>
				<pre class="codeblock">1 ( ) : unselected radio button
2 (X) : selected radio button</pre>
				<p>To check or uncheck a check box, enter its corresponding 
				number and press Enter.</p>
				<p>To change the selected radio button, enter the number 
				associated to the new desired choice and press Enter (this will 
				automatically unselect the previous choice).</p>
				<p>According to the installer's configuration, the
				<code>Select All</code> and <code>
				Select None</code> choices may be available.</p>
				<p>Then, you can either use numbers 1 to n as usual, or you can 
				enter 0 and press Enter in order to unselect all the check
