		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>When there are several code level (ex V5R18, V5R19, V6R2010x) still 
		opened to the development, upgrading a Feature catalog must be done very 
		carefully. If the previous article &quot;Managing StartUp Catalog&quot; [<a href="#References">1</a>] 
		gives you the technical information to realize this upgrade, this 
		article presents the problematic, the issue, and finally advice to do 
		safely a catalog modification. </p>

<h2><a name="Problematic"></a>Problematic</h2>
<p>DS has a simple rule : Any CATIA version must be able to read any documents 
created in a previous version. Usually DS calls this &quot;Downward&quot; 
compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li>A document created in V5Rn is older than one created N releases later, 
	V5Rn &lt;V5Rn +N</li>
	<li>A document created in V5RnSPx is older that one created at the next 
	release, V5RnSPx &lt;V5Rn+1</li>
	<li>Between V5 and V6, the date of the GA of each level, defines which is 
	older.&nbsp;&nbsp; V62009 (GA&nbsp; in 2009) is older than V521 (GA 2010).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>For Feature data, it means that the current run-time view (RTV) must contain the 
definition of all StartUp (and their attributes) that are required to read a 
document of a previous version.&nbsp; It's why the Feature catalog upgrade 
process only adds new StartUps, new attributes, and never deletes them. Taken a 
simple example: in V5R18 you create a StartUp, and documents containing 
instances of this StartUp are created. Some releases later, you change the 
format of one attribute from one integer to three integers. If the CATFctEditorAssistant tool&nbsp; [<a href="#References">1</a>] 
removed the &quot;old&quot; attribute, to only create the new one (with 3 integers), how 
you could read the feature created in V5R18 and containing one attribute? </p>
<p>When you create or update a catalog, the objects you create (Containers, Startups) are assigned new UUIDs. 
When a catalog is upgraded to higher levels, no UUID is ever changed, so that 
when data is read on higher versions, all links stand resolved. </p>
<p>Also one cannot downgrade a catalog. There is no CATBack for catalogs. 
CATBack is only for user documents.</p>

<h2><a name="Issue"></a>Issue</h2>
<p>The issue will be exposed through two examples: the first is a modification 
between two V5 levels, and the second one is between a V5 and V6 level. </p>
<p><strong>V5/V5 Modification</strong></p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompV5V5.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>First (1), you modify MyCatalog.CATfct in V5R20 to add the new StartUp 
	&quot;Extrude&quot;. The current CATfct in your RTV comes from V5R18. The 
	identifier of the new StartUp is #3. </li>
	<li>Then (2), you need a change in a version lower that V5R20, here V5R19. 
	Suppose that MyCatalog.CATfct in the V5R19 RTV comes from V5R18. So the new StartUp, here Chamfer, has also the number 
	#3. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you will read a document created in V5R19 in a version upper or equal to 
V5R20, you will have a problem. All instances of StartUp #3 inside a V5R19 document
read in V5R20 are considered as Extrude and not Chamfer.</p>
<p><strong>V5/V6 Modification</strong></p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompV5V6.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>First (1), you modify MyCatalog.CATfct in V6R2011x to add the new StartUp 
	&quot;Chamfer&quot;.&nbsp; You upgrade it from the current level in V5 (V5R18). The 
	identifier of the new StartUp is #3. </li>
	<li>Then (2), you need a change in V5R20, so 
	you upgrade the catalog MyCatalog.CATfct from the same catalog coming from 
	the V5 RTV (V5R18). So the new StartUp, here Extrude, has also the number 
	#3. </li>
</ul>

<p>When you will read a document created in V5R20 in V6R2011x (which is more 
recent that V5R20), you will have a problem. All instances of StartUp #3 inside a V5R20 document 
read in V6R2011x are considered as Chamfer and not Extrude.   </p>
<p>Infact this issue is the same as the one illustrated earlier, except that we 
deal with two versions here namely. V5 and V6. But fundamentally what we intend 
to emphasize here is that V5 and V6 must not be considered as distinct branches.</p>

<h2><a name="Process"></a>Process</h2>
<p>When you have to upgrade a Feature catalog you have rules to follow:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use the right release for the CATFctEditorAssistant tool</li>
	<li>Use the right CATfct to upgrade</li>
	<li>Place the upgraded catalog at the right places </li>
</ol>
<p>First, let us describe each rules, and then an example will be used to 
illustrate the purpose.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="Process details"></a>Process details</h3>
<p>This section explains each rules. </p>
<h4>Use the Right Release for the CATFctEditorAssistant Tool</h4>
<p>You must use the older version where you have still code to maintain. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Your catalog has been created in V5, whatever the upgrade's level (for 
	V5 or V6) , if you have still code in V5, use a V5 version</li>
	<li>Your catalog has been created in V6, and for only V6 purpose, use a V6 
	version</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason is simple: As soon as a catalog is created on a version, all older 
CATIA versions could not use it anymore.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Use the Right CATfct to Upgrade</h4>
<p>Whatever the version where do you want an upgrade of your catalog, you must 
always use the LAST upgraded CATfct. It means that in the time you must be able 
to know which is the lastest version of the CATfct. </p>
<h4>Deliver the Upgraded Catalog at the Right Places </h4>
<p>The new catalog must be delivered in all versions from the current to update and 
the newer ones. </p>
<p>If the catalog exists in V5 and V6, and the catalog modification occurs in 
V5, deliver the new catalog on V5 and V6 levels, and if the modification 
occurs in V6, you deliver the new catalog in V6 and V5 too. In this last case, 
the delivery in V5 levels is a recommendation to enable the CATBack tool.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="Illustration"></a>Illustration</h3>
<p>To avoid any confusion with existing (or future) releases, this section uses 
&quot;generic&quot; release numbers : V5R1 , V5R2, ..., V6R1, V6R2, ...,&nbsp; where&nbsp; 
the number of the release only means that RX is older than X+1. The timing 
between V5 and V6 is arbitrarily chosen as depicted by this schema:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompReleases.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>The upper line represents the V5 versions in the time</li>
	<li>The lower line represents the V6 versions in the time</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose you have 2 catalogs, one created in V5R2 (A) and one created in 
V6R1 (B), and only for V6 development. </p>
	<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompCatalogStep1.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

		<ul>
			<li>V1 means the version 1. </li>
			<li>Catalog A exists from V5R2 to V5R6, and from V6R1 to V6R4, and 
			catalog B exists for all versions from V6R2 to V6R4. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now, suppose that level V5R1 , V5R2 and V5R3 are closed for the 
	maintenance. </p>
	
	<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompCatalogStep2.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

		<p>Lets us consider five cases of upgrade.</p>
		<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h4><a name="Upgrade the catalog A for V5R5."></a>Upgrade the catalog A for V5R5.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>CATFctEditorAssistant is run on V5R4 level, the lowest version still under maintenance. </li>
	<li>A to upgrade is V1</li>
	<li>The new version V2 is delivered in V5R5 and all subsequent releases: V5R5 and V5R6, and V6R3 to V6R4 </li>
</ul>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompCatalogStep3.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

		
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: B has been temporary removed from the picture for a lighter schema.</p>
		<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h4>Upgrade the catalog A for V5R4.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>CATFctEditorAssistant is run on V5R4 level, the lowest version still under maintenance</li>
	<li>A to upgrade is V2</li>
	<li>The new version V3 is delivered in  V5R4 and all subsequent releases, therefore  V5R4 and V6R2 to V6R4  </li>
</ul>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompCatalogStep4.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>This example shows the significance to use the lowest version still under 
maintenance for the CATFctEditorAssistant tool. If in the previous upgrade,
<a href="#Upgrade the catalog A for V5R5.">Upgrade the catalog A for V5R5</a>, 
A-V2 would have been generated with the V5R5 version of CATFctEditorAssistant, 
this catalog would be disable in V5R4. CATFctEditorAssistant and all CATIA 
version lower than V5R5 cannot use a catalog created in a upper level. </p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h4>Upgrade the catalog A for V6R2.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>CATFctEditorAssistant is run on V5R4 level, the lowest version still under maintenance</li>
	<li>A to upgrade is V3</li>
	<li>The new version V4 is delivered in V6R2 and all subsequent releases, therefore V6R2 to V6R4, and 
	as recommended <a href="#Process details">#</a> , in the V5 versions too, so V5R5 and V5R6</li>
</ul>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompCatalogStep5.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h4>Upgrade the catalog  B for V6R4.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>CATFctEditorAssistant is on V6R1 level ,the lowest version still under maintenance for catalog B </li>
	<li>B to upgrade is V1</li>
	<li>The new version V2 is delivered in V6R4 and all subsequent releases, so only V6R4.
 Here the update of the V5 is useless , there is no impact on that version.</li>
</ul>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAAFmExtTaCatalogCompCatalogStep6.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Note: A has been temporary removed from the picture for a lighter schema.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h4>Special Upgrade</h4>
<p>For some special kind of catalog's modifications, it is possible to use the 
current version of the CATFctEditorAssistant tool. Some examples of possible 
operations are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Change the default value of a string attribute</li>
	<li>Transform the local property of a feature extension (local -&gt; non local) </li>
</ul>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p>Upgrading a Feature catalog requires a strict process to ensure the correct reading 
of documents created with a lower version.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use the right release for the CATFctEditorAssistant tool</li>
	<li>Use the right CATfct to upgrade</li>
	<li>Deliver the upgraded catalog at the right places </li>
</ol>
