		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>This article discusses the <code>CAAFmExtSynchronizeFeatAttr</code> use 
		case. A feature component attribute is not inherited, as the other attributes 
		are. This is because a component attribute valuation results in an aggregation 
		of a feature under the parent feature. Since a feature can be aggregated 
		essentially only under a single parent feature, a component attribute value 
		cannot be inherited.</p>
		<p>This use case is an illustration of the concepts described by the &quot;<strong>Understanding 
		Component Synchronization</strong>&quot; [<a href="#References">1</a>] article.</p>
		<p>An understanding of the <strong>Feature-Instance</strong> model (by a 
		study of the technical article &quot;<strong>Feature Modeler Concepts</strong> 
		&quot; [<a href="#References">2</a>]) and that of component-type attributes (by 
		a study of the technical article on &quot;<strong>Understanding Feature Attributes</strong>&quot; 
		[<a href="#References">3</a>]) is recommended before proceeding.</p>

<h2><a name="Learn"></a>What You Will Learn With This Use Case</h2>
<p>The Use Case illustrates to an end-user the fundamental concepts involved in 
synchronizing a feature instance attribute of type component with its reference. 
The attributes are of type component and component-list, which implies the synchronization 
actually involves an update of the features aggregated under the feature.</p>

<h2><a name="UseCase"></a>The CAAFmExtSynchronizeFeatAttr Use Case</h2>
<p><code>CAAFmExtSynchronizeFeatAttr</code> is a use case of the <code>CAAFeatureModelerExt.edu</code> 
framework that illustrates <code>FeatureModelerExt</code> framework capabilities.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="What"></a>What Does CAAFmExtSynchronizeFeatAttr Do</h3>
<p>The UC illustrates synchronization of a feature attribute. Primarily we deal 
with two types of attributes namely. <strong>component</strong> and <strong>component 
list</strong>. Since we deal with component type attributes, we are fundamentally 
dealing with aggregated features. This further involves two cases that of immediate 
aggregation and that of a recursive aggregation.</p>
<p>The UC defines 3 distinct scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="#Case 1: Feature with component type attributes (Immediate aggregation of features under a parent feature)">
	Feature with component type attributes (Immediate aggregation of features under 
	a parent feature)</a></li>
	<li>
	<a href="#Case 2: Feature with component-list type attributes (Immediate aggregation of a list of features under a parent feature)">
	Feature with component-list type attributes (Immediate aggregation of a list 
	of features under a parent feature)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Case 3: Synchronizing of feature attributes is not recursive">
	Synchronizing of feature attributes is not recursive</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this<strong></strong> use case all StartUps are defined in the following catalog 
:<code> CAAFmExtCatalogForUnderstandingSynchro.CATfct.</code> By convention:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A is either an instance of <strong>CAAFmExt_A_withCompAttr, or CAAFmExt_A_CAAFmExt_A_withListCompAttr</strong> 
	or <strong>CAAFmExt_Arec</strong> (the scenario specifies it)</li>
	<li><strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D, E, F, G, H, I , J , U, 
	V , W,</strong> and <strong>X</strong> are respectively instances of <strong>CAAFmExt_B , CAAFmExt_C, ...</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>A&#39;</strong> is an instance of <strong>A</strong> , <strong>B</strong>&#39; 
	is an instance of <strong>B</strong>, ....</li>
	<li><strong>A&#39;&#39;</strong> an instance of <strong>A&#39;</strong> , <strong>B</strong>&#39;&#39; 
	is an instance of <strong>B&#39;</strong>, ....</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets us describe in details each scenario.</p>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h4><strong>
<a name="Case 1: Feature with component type attributes (Immediate aggregation of features under a parent feature)">
</a>Case 1</strong>: <strong>Feature with component type attributes (Immediate aggregation 
of features under a parent feature)</strong></h4>
<p>The UC executes on a feature model depicted in [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>] that 
follows. <strong></strong></p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.1"></a>Fig. 1 Input Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td><img alt="Input Model" src="images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig2.png">
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>A</strong>, a <strong>CAAFmExt_A_withCompAttr</strong> startup instance, 
aggregates <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong> and
<strong>E</strong> realized by valuating its attributes <strong>attr1</strong>,
<strong>attr2</strong>, <strong>attr3</strong> and <strong>attr4</strong>.</p>
<p>On instantiating <strong>A</strong>, it results in <strong>A&#39;</strong>, as depicted 
in [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>]. <strong>A&#39;</strong> now aggregates <strong>B&#39;</strong>,
<strong>C&#39;</strong>, <strong>D&#39;</strong> and <strong>E&#39;</strong>. A significant 
point to note here is that the aggregated features under the instantiated feature
<strong>A&#39;</strong>, are distinct from those aggregated under the reference feature
<strong>A</strong>. This is owing to the fact that a feature can be aggregated only 
under a single parent feature. Hence instantiating a parent feature results in instantiation 
of the aggregated features as well.</p>
<p>Next, the model is modified as depicted in the [<a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>] that 
follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.2"></a>Fig. 2 Model for Synchronization</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Model for Synchronization" src="images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig3.png"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>A</strong> is updated by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Deleting <strong>B</strong>, which was aggregated under it.</li>
	<li>Replacing <strong>D</strong> with <strong>U</strong>, aggregated under it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A&#39;</strong> is updated by</p>
<ul>
	<li>Deleting <strong>C&#39;</strong>, which was aggregated under it.</li>
	<li>Replacing <strong>E&#39;</strong> with <strong>V</strong>, aggregated under 
	it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus now we arrive at a feature model where our Feature Reference is asynchronous 
with the Feature Instance. On synchronization of <strong>A&#39;</strong> attributes, 
the resulting model is as depicted in [<a href="#Fig.3">Fig. 3</a>] below. It results 
in an update of <strong>A&#39;</strong> which now aggregates instances of features aggregated 
under <strong>A</strong>, if those exist, realized by valuating each of the feature 
attributes. If a feature attribute on the reference side does not aggregate a feature, 
it reflects on the instance side as well, realized by destroying the corresponding 
feature aggregated.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.3"></a>Fig.3 Synchronized Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Synchronized Model" src="images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig4.png"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>You&#39;ll observe thus that <strong>A&#39;</strong> update results in:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>B&#39;</strong>, aggregated under it is destroyed. This is because
	<strong>A</strong> currently does not aggregate a feature under it, by realizing 
	the valuation of its attribute <strong>attr1</strong>. As a result, <strong>
	A&#39;</strong> attribute <strong>attr1</strong> on synchronization reflects the 
	same state as that of <strong>A</strong>. This results in destroying the
	<strong>B&#39;</strong> feature, aggregated beneath <strong>A&#39;</strong>, realized 
	by its attribute <strong>attr1</strong> valuation.</li>
	<li><strong>C&#39;&#39;</strong> is a new feature aggregated under <strong>A&#39;</strong> 
	on synchronization, realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr2</strong>. 
	This happens since <strong>A&#39; attr2</strong> attribute is valuated, on synchronization, 
	so as to realize the aggregation of a new instance of <strong>C</strong>, which 
	is an aggregation under <strong>A</strong>, realized by the valuation of its 
	attribute <strong>attr2</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>U&#39;</strong> is a new feature aggregated under <strong>A&#39;</strong>, 
	realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr3</strong>. This happens since 
	on synchronization of attribute <strong>attr3</strong> of <strong>A&#39;</strong>, 
	it is valuated such as to realize the aggregation of a new instance of
	<strong>U</strong>, the feature aggregated under <strong>A</strong>, realized 
	by valuating its attribute <strong>attr3</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>E&#39;&#39;</strong> is a new feature aggregated under <strong>A&#39;</strong>, 
	realized by valuating its attribute <strong>attr4</strong>. This happens since 
	on synchronization of attribute <strong>attr4</strong> of <strong>A&#39;</strong>, 
	it is valuated such as to realize the aggregation of new instance of <strong>
	E</strong>, the feature aggregated under <strong>A</strong>, realized by valuating 
	its attribute <strong>attr4</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we proceed to illustrate synchronization of a feature attribute of type 
component list.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h4><strong>
<a name="Case 2: Feature with component-list type attributes (Immediate aggregation of a list of features under a parent feature)">
</a>Case 2</strong>: <strong>Feature with component-list type attributes (Immediate 
aggregation of a list of features under a parent feature)</strong></h4>
<p>The UC here illustrates the concept of synchronization for a feature attribute 
of type <strong>component-list</strong>. One such feature <strong>A</strong>, a 
is as depicted below [<a href="#Fig.4">Fig. 4</a>]].</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.4"></a>Fig.4 Input Model</caption>
	<tr>

	</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>A</strong>, a <strong>CAAFmExt_A_withListCompAttr</strong>, aggregates:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr1</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr2</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>F</strong> and <strong>G</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr3</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>H</strong> and <strong>I</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
	<strong>attr4</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On instantiating <strong>A</strong>, it results in <strong>A&#39;</strong>, as depicted 
in [<a href="#Fig.4">Fig.4</a>] above.</p>
<p><strong>A&#39;</strong> now aggregates instances of all features that are aggregated 
under its reference <strong>A</strong>. Moreover the aggregation is realized by 
valuating the same attributes on the instance side, as those that exist on the reference 
side. It is worthwhile re-emphasizing here that the aggregated features on the reference 
and instance side are distinct, since a feature can be aggregated essentially under 
a single parent, at any given point of time.</p>
<p>Now the UC proceeds to illustrate the impact of synchronization on an attribute 
of type <strong>component-list</strong> of a feature instance. To begin with, the
<strong>A</strong> and <strong>A&#39;</strong> are modified as depicted in [<a href="#Fig.5">Fig.5</a>] 
below.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.5"></a>Fig.5 Model for Synchronization</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Model for Synchronization" src="images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig6.png"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The modification consists of</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>A</strong> now aggregates <strong>U</strong>, as well, realized 
	by updating the value of its attribute <strong>attr1</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>A&#39;</strong> now aggregates <strong>W</strong>, as well, realized 
	by updating the value of its attribute <strong>attr2</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>A</strong> now aggregates <strong>V</strong> and <strong>V&#39;</strong> 
	aggregates <strong>X</strong>, both realized by updating the value of their 
	attribute <strong>attr3</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>A</strong> no longer aggregates <strong>J</strong>, which is eventually 
	destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>With those changes to our basic feature model, we now proceed to synchronize 
all attributes of <strong>A&#39;</strong>. This synchronization results in an update 
of our feature model as depicted in the [<a href="#Fig.6">Fig.6</a>] that follows.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.6"></a>Fig.6 Synchronized Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Synchronized Model" src="images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig7.png"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>On Synchronization of each attribute of <strong>A&#39;</strong>, it results in</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>A&#39;</strong> now aggregates <strong>U&#39;</strong> (an instance of
	<strong>U</strong>, on the reference side) as well, realized by an update of 
	its attribute <strong>attr1</strong> valuation</li>
	<li><strong>A&#39;</strong> which had explicitly aggregated <strong>W</strong> under 
	it, pre-synchronization, remains intact post-synchronization.</li>
	<li><strong>A&#39;</strong> now also aggregates <strong>V&#39;</strong> (an instance 
	of <strong>V</strong>, on the reference side) under it, realized by an update 
	of its attribute <strong>attr3</strong> valuation. An important point to note 
	here is that <strong>X</strong> explicitly aggregated by <strong>A&#39;</strong>, 
	realized by updating the valuation of the same attribute <strong>attr3</strong>, 
	remains intact. Another significant point to note is that the order of the aggregated 
	features under the feature instance, are those under the feature reference followed 
	by those under the feature instance, essentially in that order. Hence
	<strong>V&#39;</strong> precedes <strong>X</strong>, in the list.</li>
	<li><strong>A&#39;</strong> no longer aggregates <strong>J&#39;</strong>, which is eventually 
	destroyed, since <strong>J</strong>, no longer exists on the reference side 
	and synchronization merely reflects this state on the instance side, as well.</li>

<h4><strong>
<a name="Case 3: Synchronizing of feature attributes is not recursive"></a>Case 
3</strong>: <strong>Synchronizing of feature attributes is not recursive</strong></h4>
<p>Consider the model below [<a href="#Fig.7">Fig.7</a>]. It consists of <strong>
A</strong>, a <strong>CAAFmExt_Arec</strong> Startup Instance, which aggregates
<strong>B</strong> (a <strong>CAAFmExt_Brec</strong>), realized 
by valuating its attribute <strong>attr1</strong>. Further <strong>B</strong> aggregates
<strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong>, realized by valuating its attribute
<strong>attr2</strong>. Thus, finally we achieve here a recursive aggregation under 
the parent <strong>A</strong>.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.7"></a>Fig.7 Input Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td><img alt="Input Model" src="images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig8.png"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>A</strong> is instantiated which results in <strong>A&#39;</strong>. The 
resulting <strong>A&#39;</strong> aggregates <strong>B&#39;</strong> which in turn aggregates,
<strong>D&#39;</strong> and <strong>E&#39;</strong>. The features aggregated beneath
<strong>A&#39;</strong> are instances of corresponding features aggregated under
<strong>A</strong>. The instantiation is mandatory owing to the fact that an aggregated 
feature can have only a single parent feature.</p>
<p>We proceed to modify this model [<a href="#Fig.8">Fig.8</a>], to illustrate the 
impact of synchronization in the steps ahead.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.8"></a>Fig.8 Model for Synchronization</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Model for Synchronization" src="images/CAAFmExtTaSynchroAggr_Fig9.png"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The <strong>D</strong> aggregated under <strong>B</strong> is deleted. Next, 
we call synchronization of the attribute <strong>attr1</strong> of <strong>A&#39;</strong>. 
The model remains unimpacted. In other words, <strong>D&#39;</strong> still continues 
to exist recursively aggregated under <strong>A&#39;</strong>. The synchronization does 
not propagate down the feature model aggregation hierarchy.</p>
<p>Further we call synchronization on attribute <strong>attr2</strong> of
<strong>B&#39;.</strong> This synchronization now, results in the desired impact on 
our feature model. <strong>attr2</strong> of <strong>B&#39;</strong> only contains
<strong>E&#39;</strong>. Thus, it illustrates that synchronization must be explicitly 
called on feature attributes and one cannot rely on this synchronization propagating 
to all feature attributes down the aggregation hierarchy, recursively.</p>

<strong>CATFmCredentials MyCredential</strong>;
...
<strong>CATFmFeatureFacade oFeatFacadeOnFeatAA (MyCredential)</strong>
...</pre>
<p>The feature under consideration is represented by a <em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em> 
type (oFeatFacadeOnFeatAA). We invoke synchronization on its attribute Attr1, in 
the next step. This attribute is represented by Attr1Name, a <em>CATFmAttributeName</em> 
type.</p>
<pre class="code">...
rc = <strong>oFeatFacadeOnFeatAA.Synchronize(Attr1Name)</strong>;

<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p>This Use Case illustrates the concept of synchronization of a feature attribute. 
A feature is an instance of a StartUp or another feature. It is characterized by 
attributes. Any modification of this attribute value in the reference must essentially 
get reflected in the instances as well, down the feature instantiation hierarchy, 
going by the fundamentals of a Reference-Instance model. But this does not happen 
by default. An explicit synchronization call must be invoked on a feature attribute 
to realize its synchronization with its attribute value, in the reference, up the 
instantiation hierarchy.</p>
<p>We fundamentally deal with a feature attribute of type <strong>component</strong> 
and <strong>component-list</strong>. Thus the synchronization actually involves 
an update of the features aggregated under feature instances, in sync with those 
aggregated under the feature reference.</p>
