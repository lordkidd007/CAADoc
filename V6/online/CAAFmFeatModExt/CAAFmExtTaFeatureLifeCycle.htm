<h2><a name="Feature Creation"></a>Feature Creation</h2>
<p>This first chapter describes how features are created, and where they are 
stored. Some additional information about the aggregation principles are 
integrated too.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="From StartUp or Feature"></a>From StartUp or Feature</h3>
<p>A feature is usually created (or instantiated) from a <strong>StartUp</strong>, a feature&#8217;s 
&#8220;<strong>template</strong>&#8221; stored inside a <strong>feature catalog</strong> [<a href="#References">1</a>]. 
But, a feature can be also created from another one for some specific, and 
almost rare, scenarios. In both cases, in order to do the creation you have to 
be the owner of the feature catalog containing the StartUp to instantiate 
(directly or not). Indeed, as usual, this operation is protected as described by 
the technical article &#8220;<strong>Understanding Credentials</strong>&#8221; [<a href="#References"><span >2</span></a>].</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig1"></a>Fig. 1 Feature Creation</caption>

</table>
<p>[<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>] depicts</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>Feature A</code> is created from its <strong>StartUp</strong></li>
	<li><code>Feature A'</code> (*) is created from <strong>Feature A</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(*) by 
	convention, in this article, <code>&nbsp;X'</code> means an instance of
	<code>X</code>, <code>X&quot;</code> and instance of <code>&nbsp;X'</code> 
and so one. </p>
<p>When a feature is created from another one, the latter is named the<strong> 
Reference</strong> feature. <code>Feature A</code> is the reference of <code>Feature A', 
</code>but there is no Reference feature for <code>Feature A.</code> </p>
<p><strong>About API</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> </strong>instantiation methods are available on the <em>CATFmStartUpFacade</em> 
class for a StartUp's instantiation, and on the <em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em> 
class for a feature's instantiation. Since an initial introduction to these APIs 
is required, their names are unveiled in the next section only. Nevertheless, we can 
already said whatever the API, the newly created feature is returned as a <em>
CATFmFeatureFacade</em> class instance.</p>
<p>The reference feature can be retrieved thanks to the <code>GetReference </code> 
method of the <em>CATFmFeatureFacade </em>
class. This method returns the feature as a <em>CATFmAttributeValue </em>class. </p>
<p>The StartUp of any feature can be retrieved thanks to the <code>GetStartUpFacade</code> 
method of the <em>CATFmFeatureFacade.</em> It returns the StartUp as a <em>CATFmStartUpFacade
</em>class. It returns the StartUp used to instantiate directly the feature (<code>StartUpA </code>for<code> Feature A)</code>, like the initial StartUp 
for a recursive 
instantiation. (<code>StartUpA</code> for <code>Feature A'</code>).</p>
<p>Have a look to the use case &quot;Working with Feature Facade&quot; [<a href="#References"><span >3</span></a>]<em>
</em>for more implementation details.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="StandAlone or Aggregated"></a>Stand-Alone or Aggregated</h3>
<p>First a recall. A feature is either stand-alone (pointed or not), or 
aggregated under another feature. The concept of 
aggregation is dealt in the technical article [<a href="#References"><span class="style1">4</span></a>]. [<a href="#Fig2">Fig.2</a>], 
just below, shows Feature B aggregated by feature A through the component attribute
<code>Attr1</code> of feature A.</p>
<table style="width: 329px">
	<caption><a name="Fig2"></a>Fig. 2 Aggregation using Component Attribute</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="images/CAAFmExtTaFeatureLC_Fig2.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>To create a feature, the first method is <code>InstantiateIn. </code>It is available on the <em>
CATFmFeatureFacade</em> class (for a creation from a <strong>feature</strong>), and 
on the <em>
CATFmStartUpFacade</em> class (for a creation from a <strong>StartUp</strong>). This method creates a 
new feature as a stand-alone one.</p>
<p>If the new feature must be aggregated (<code>feature B</code> of [<a href="#Fig2">Fig.2</a>] 
for example), 
you can use this api, but you will have to do the aggregation in a second step. </p>
<p>We propose another method, <code>InstantiateUnder</code>, also 
available on the two façade classes ( <em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em>, <em>
CATFmStartUpFacade</em> ). This method creates the new feature, and does the aggregation 
too. This method requires as input the aggregating feature (<strong><code>feature A</code></strong>) and its 
component attribute (<code>attr1</code>) realizing the aggregation.</p>
<p>This method which does both the creation and aggregation simultaneously 
reduces lines of code. Indeed, this method is a concatenation of several calls:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creation of a stand-alone new feature</li>
	<li>Creation of a <em>CATFmAttributeValue</em> equivalent of the new feature</li>
	<li>Valuating the component attribute of the aggregating feature with the 
	<em>CATFmAttributeValue</em> equivalent of the new feature B, the one 
	aggregated.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>To finish, a last word about the <code>InstantiateUnder</code> method. When the attribute is 
a list of component, the newly created feature is inserted at the end of list.<br>
</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="Stored in Container"></a>Stored in Container</h3>
<p>A feature is stored, or saved, in a container. Let us present what it is.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig. 3"></a>Fig. 3 Container, the Persistency Structure</caption>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/CAAFmExtTaFeatureLC_Fig3.gif"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>A container is part of a streamed entity aggregated by a <strong>PLM Representation 
Reference </strong>(<strong>Rep Ref</strong>), as depicted by [<a href="#Fig. 3">Fig.3</a>] above. A container is an 
object modeler base (<strong>OMB</strong>) structure, so it can contain features 
as any kind object implementing a protocol recognizable by OMB. But in CAA 
context, you only handle container for features. According to the Rep Ref, containers in the streamed structure can be 
DS containers, or and CAA containers. We recommend users to study the article &#8220;<strong>Understanding 
Applicative Container</strong>&#8221; [<a href="#References"><span class="style1">5</span></a>] to gain a better 
insight into the concepts of a container, as the way to retrieve or create one, and where to store your feature according to the 
kind of application.</p>
<p><strong>About API</strong></p>
<p>Just a word about the container access. In the Feature modeler context, a 
container is handled through a <em>CATFmContainerFacade</em> class, since its 
access is also secured by credential [<a href="#References">2</a>]. In Feature 
modeler, there is no API to handle freely a container, but you can have DS 
application/ DS modeler API to handle&nbsp; their respective containers.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="About Aggregated feats"></a>About Aggregated Features</h3>
<p>The case of the aggregated features is interesting for many reasons detailed 
in this section.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Lifecycle"><strong></strong></a><strong>Life Cycle</strong></h4>
<p>Once a feature is aggregated, it cannot be aggregated by another one 
	(methods doing the aggregation do the check). Nevertheless, once aggregated, 
	a feature can always be &#8220;<strong>detached</strong>&#8221;, and thus become 
<strong>stand-alone</strong> again. (<code>DetachComponent</code> method of the 
<em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em> class)<p>
	The lifecycle of an aggregated feature is governed by the feature that 
	aggregates it. In other words, an aggregated feature lasts only as long as 
	the feature that aggregates it. It will be shown in the 
	<a href="#Feat deletion">delete</a> section 
	hereafter</p>
	<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
	
<a name="Parent root parent"><strong></strong></a>
<h4><strong>Parent/ Root Parent</strong></h4>
<p>We refer to an aggregating feature as a <strong>Parent</strong> of the 
feature that it directly aggregates. The <strong>root parent</strong> is the last feature without 
itself a parent feature following a bottom up approach on the parent's 
hierarchy. The two terms are better understood, by studying the picture that follows:</p>
<table>
	<caption class="style18"><a name="Fig.4"></a>Fig. 4 </caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="images/CAAFmExtTaFeatureLC_Fig4.gif" width="302" height="160"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
	<p>Feature <code>A</code> is the &#8220;<strong>root parent</strong>&#8221; of 
	<code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. Feature <code>B</code> is the &#8220;<strong>Parent</strong>&#8221; of Feature
	<code>C</code>, and Feature <code>A</code> is the &#8220;<strong>Parent</strong>&#8221; (and 
	<strong>root</strong>) of Feature <code>B</code>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
	<strong>
<b>About API</b></strong> </p>
<p>
	The <code>GetParentFeature()</code> method of the 
<em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em> class, returns the parent of a feature. The <code>GetRootParentFeature()</code> 
method of the same class, returns the root parent of a feature</p>
<h4>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<a name="Instantiation"><strong></strong></a><strong>Instantiation</strong></h4>
<p>When a feature (or a StartUp) is instantiated all its component attributes 
with a value are instantiated too.</p>
<table>
	<caption class="style18"><a name="Fig.5"></a>Fig. 5 Component Instantiation</caption>

<ul>
	<li>(<strong>1</strong>): The startUp <code>SUA</code> has three components, one is valuated with a 
	default feature (<code>Attr3=FeatU</code>), one is a list (<code>Attr2</code>), and one a simple value 
	(<code>Attr1</code>)</li>
	<li>(<strong>2</strong>): For feature <code>A</code>, created from SUA, you can see that 
	its <code>Attr3 </code>value 
	is <code>FeatU</code>', an instance of <code>FeatU</code>.</li>
	<li>(<strong>3</strong>): For feature <code>A&#8217;</code>, created from feature
	<code>A</code> , you can see that its Attr3 
	value is <code>FeatU&#8217;&#8217;</code>, and instance of <code>FeatU</code>'.</li>
	<li>(<strong>4</strong>): Feature <code>A&#8217;</code> is modified. Its 
	attribute <code>Attr1 </code>contains a feature (<code>FeatB</code>), and 
	its attribute <code>Attr2 </code>is now a list with feature <code>FeatC</code></li>
	<li>(<strong>5</strong>): For feature <code>A&#8217;&#8217;</code>, created from feature&nbsp; <code>A&#8217;</code>, 
	you can see that&nbsp; <code>Attr3 </code>value is 
	<code>FeatU&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;</code> an<strong> </strong>instance of <code>FeatU&#8217;&#8217;</code>, and for the 
	other attributes you have new values coming from the instantiation of the 
	respective value on the reference.<br>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This process of component instantiation is recursive, and due to the fact that an aggregated feature cannot have two parents.

<h2><a name="Feat deletion"></a>Feature Deletion</h2>
<p>This second chapter describes the methods to delete a feature, and the impact 
of this deletion.</p>

<h3><a name="How to delete a feature"></a>How to Delete a Feature?</h3>
<p>The basic method to delete a feature is the <code>DeleteSelf</code> method of the <em>
CATFmFeatureFacade. </em>This method requires that you are owner of the StartUp 
defining the feature to delete, but that you are also owner of the StartUp of 
the feature aggregating it, when the feature to delete is aggregated. </p>
<p>You might also use the <code>Delete</code> method of the <em>DataCommonProtocolServices</em> 
class. This method does not require any credential. But using this API requires 
that the owner of the StartUp has given agreement, in other words the StartUp 
must support the common services protocol. Have a look at the referenced 
technical article [<a href="#References">9</a>] you would find some useful information to do the same 
thing for our own StartUp</p>
<p>The <code>Delete</code> method may not be exactly equivalent to calling <code>DeleteSelf</code> 
method. </p>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>Delete</code> method of the <em>DataCommonProtocolServices</em> class can 
introduce some tests prior to realizing the deletion. The owner of a StartUp may 
open the delete operation to everyone, but it will also ensure that the 
operation will be safe.</li>
	<li>For some DS feature the <code>Delete</code> method is based on the Cut, Copy Paste protocols&nbsp; [<a href="#References"><span class="style1">12</span></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>Another kind of call can imply a feature deletion, it is <code>RemovePosition</code> or 
<code>SetValue</code>(NULL) (<em>CATFmFeatureFacade class) </em>on an component attribute. 
The aggregated feature, holding by the component link, will be deleted by such 
calls while it is not the case for a specobject link. We have fully developed that in 
another article about link&#8217;s attribute [<a href="#References"><span class="style1">6</span></a>].</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<h3><a name="Impact of feat deletion"></a>What does a Feature Deletion&nbsp;Imply?</h3>
<p>When a feature is deleting by Feature modeler engine (whatever the order of 
deletion provides), what are the consequences for:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Impact on itself">Itself</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Impact on the Features pointing to the Deleted Feature">Its Pointing to Features (if exist)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Impact on the Feature aggregating the Deleted Feature">Its Aggregating Feature (if exists)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Impact on Features Instantiated from Deleted Features">Its Instantiated Features (if exists)</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>

<strong><a name="Impact on itself"></a>Impact on itself</strong></h4>
<p>The feature is destroyed from its container. Its deletion implies 
its own destruction, as the destruction of all its aggregated features, and all its extensions, 
and those recursively. Only, the features/objects that it points to are not impacted. We 
illustrate this with the schema that follows:</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.6"></a>Fig. 6 Data Model Before/After Deletion</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="images/CAAFmExtTaFeatLC_Fig6.jpg" width="510" height="279"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The feature to delete is named &#8220;<strong>FeatureToDelete</strong>&#8221;. This 
feature aggregates and points to some other features. Its deletion implies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;The feature A, B are still alive since they are just pointed to by 
	the feature to delete ( attr1)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The feature G, aggregated by B, is alive, because its aggregating 
	feature (B) is not impacted</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The external object is still alive &#8211; (attr2)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The Feature E, C, D are deleted because they are aggregated by the 
	feature to delete (attr3, attr4)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The feature H is deleted too, because even if it is pointed by the 
	feature to delete (by attr5), it is also aggregated by the feature to delete 
	(attr 4)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The feature F , aggregated by C is deleted, because feature C is 
	deleted (recursive process)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The extension of the feature to delete are deleted, like the one 
	of its deleted features ( feature C, and Feature F). But the extensions of 
	feature A, a feature still alive, are alive too</li>
</ul>


<p>This description is the default behavior of a feature&#8217;s deletion. This 
	behavior can be nevertheless customized as explained in another article [<a href="#References"><span class="style1">13</span></a>]. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once feature modeler is deleting a feature, the 
credentials are not checked. The deletion of the aggregated/extensions feature does 
not check the credential.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>


<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>


<strong><a name="Impact on the Features pointing to the Deleted Feature"></a>Impact 
On Pointing to Features</strong></h4>
<p>When feature modeler is deleting a feature pointing by another ones, what are 
the impacts for these features.</p>
<p>The next 
picture [<a href="#References">Fig.7</a>] displays the two kinds of attributes 
which can point to a feature: a <strong>specobject</strong> and a <strong>list 
of specobject</strong>. Both cases are interesting to consider.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.7"></a>Fig. 7 Pointing Features</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="images/CAAFmExtTaFeatLC_Fig7.gif" width="289" height="110"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><code>Feature A</code> points to the feature to delete through <code>attr2</code> a simple attribute, and 
<code>Feature B</code> points to the 
same feature through <code>attr1</code> a list of features.</p>
<p>If the feature to delete is pointed to by other features, the value of their 
attribute is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;For a single attribute (<code>attr2</code>) : a NULL value </li>
	<li>&nbsp;For a list (<code>attr1</code>): 
	<ul>
		<li>The attribute hasn't the array facet, the list is reduced from one 
	element</li>
		<li>The attribute has the array facet,&nbsp; a NULL value is replaced in 
		place of the deleted feature.&nbsp; </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>First you must be aware that conversely to a pointed feature, an aggregated 
feature cannot be deleted if its aggregating feature is not in session.</p>
<p>But otherwise the behavior is the same as for a specoject attribute 
link. When an aggregated feature is deleted, the value of attribute aggregating 
the deleted feature becomes :</p>
</strong>
<ul>
	 
	<li>For a single attribute : a NULL value </li>
	<li>For a list : </li>
	<li>
	<ul>
		<li>The attribute hasn't the array facet, the list is reduced from one 
	element</li>
		<li>The attribute has the array facet,&nbsp; a NULL value is replaced in

<p>In this situation, the data model can be in a bad condition. For example, if 
the value of an attribute of an instantiated feature had to be read from its 
reference (inherited mode), the algorithm to retrieve the value will fail. </p>
