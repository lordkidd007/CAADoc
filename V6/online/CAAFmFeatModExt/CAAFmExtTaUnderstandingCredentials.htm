<h2><a name="Facade principle"></a>Facade Principle</h2>
<p>A facade object is a C++ class encapsulating a feature modeler entity and exposing 
services which provide a secured (controlled) access to the underlying entity. You 
have a facade for a StartUp (<em>CATFmStartUpFacade</em>), a feature ( <em>CATFmFeatureFacade</em>), 
or a container (<em>CATFmContainerFacade</em>).</p>
<p>The services exposed by the facade include introspection, modification and instantiation. 
These services are successful only if the facade is associated with credentials 
authorizing these operations. The concept of credentials is explained in the next 
section.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h2><a name="Credential Principle"></a>Credentials Principle</h2>
<p>A credentials object is a C++ class holding accreditations. When you ask for 
a feature data model access, primarily you must show your accreditations, or in 
other words your identity. According to your profile, feature modeler either grants 
or restricts access.</p>
<p>The credentials object is the <em>CATFmCredentials</em> class providing methods 
to register you as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Register as an application based on specific infrastructure">Working 
	on the top of a specific infrastructure</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Register as owner of startup catalog">Owner of a StartUp&#39;s catalog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s us detail these two ideas.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="Register as an application based on specific infrastructure"></a>Register 
as Application Based on an Infrastructure</h3>
<p>When you are working with Feature modeler, you are working with containers [<a href="#References">1</a>] 
storing the Feature data model. The application owning the container (the one having 
created the container) can decide to choose an &quot;infrastructure&quot; to either prohibit 
or limit access to the Container. Each infrastructure having a specific behavior 
&quot;exposes&quot; an identification key. You have to register as an application based on 
a given infrastructure. So, when you are working with a container, through its facade, 
Feature Modeler checks with the application owning the container, if one of the 
credentials grants authorization for the current operation. </p>
<p>As of today, the only one exposed infrastructure is &quot;Feature Modeler&quot; infrastructure. 
This infrastructure grants you to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Instantiate your feature in any kind of container</li>
	<li>Retrieve your feature from any kind of container</li>
</ul>
<p>By any kind of container, it implies either a DS or an Applicative Container. 
If an application creates its own applicative containers, the authorization to work 
with this applicative container will be always granted fundamentally by the feature 
modeler infrastructure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the authorization to work with DS Containers (for e.g
<code>CATPrtCont</code> defined by Mechanical Modeler) is granted by the Feature 
Modeler infrastructure today, while in future, it is possible that the applications 
owning the DS Containers, might define their own IDs, for access authorization to 
clients. The privileges granted then to the client could either be more restrictive 
or permissive, than those provided by the Feature Modeler Infrastructure today.</p>
<p>Also, as of today, all feature modeler clients have authorization to work with 
an Applicative Container, while in future we can either prohibit or permit the usage 
of our containers for third party applications.</p>
<p>Each identification key will specify the container behaviors: </p>
<ul>
	<li>For instantiation purpose.</li>
	<li>For scanning purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>The method to register an application as based on a given infrastructure is the
<code>RegisterAsApplicationBasedOn </code>method of the <em>CATFmCredentials</em> 
class. </p>
<pre class="code">#include &quot;CATFmFeatureModelerID.h&quot;
CATFmCredentials MyCredentials;
CATUnicodeString iPartnerId =&quot;XXXyyy&quot;;
MyCredentials.<strong>RegisterAsApplicationBasedOn</strong>(CATFmFeatureModelerID,iPartnerId);</pre>
<p>The arguments of this method are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A pointer to a key identifying the infrastructure.</li>
	<li>A string representing your Partner identification for mainly licensing purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Partner Identifier</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are a Partner of DS, in the PID, you have a Partner identifier. This 
	name is the one to use with this APIs. </li>
	<li>if you are a customer, although you don&#39;t have a Partner identifier, this 
	string cannot be NULL, and must be chosen carefully. It is strongly recommended 
	to use an identifier starting with the trigram of your society. This name will 
	be the one to use if one day you request to be a DS&#39;s partner.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your application could be based on several kind of infrastructures (when it 
will be possible), the PartnerId string used for each declaration should be the 
same name. A credential class instance can have only one PartnerId. </p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<!-- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-comment-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<h3><a name="Register as owner of startup catalog"></a>Register as an Owner of a 
StartUp&#39;s Catalog</h3>
<p>When you are the owner of a Startup&#8217;s Catalog (a CATFct file), you are responsible 
for defining and managing a data model. Feature modeler considers that anyone identifying 
himself/herself as an &#8220;owner of a catalog&#8221; can be fully granted access to the data 
created from this catalog.</p>
<p>As an owner of a feature catalog, for each of its StartUps you can instantiate 
them, and for each instance you can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Retrieve and modify its attributes.</li>
	<li>Manage its lifecycle.</li>
	<li>Manage its extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless to be a catalog&#39;s owner, can be insufficient for the instantiation. 
As partner, you will also have a a licensing test based on your PartnerId. See the
<a href="#Register as an application based on specific infrastructure">section</a> 
just above. </p>
<p>Such a credential is granted by the <code>RegisterAsCatalogOwner </code>method 
of the <em>CATFmCredentials</em> class. </p>
<pre class="code">CATFmCredentials MyCredentials;
CATUnicodeString iCatalogName =&quot;CAAFmExtDeleteCatalog&quot; ;
CATUnicodeString iClient-Id =&quot;MyClientId&quot; ;
MyCredentials.<strong>RegisterAsCatalogOwner</strong>(iCatalogName ,iClient-Id);</pre>
<p>The input parameters to this method are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Feature catalog name, without its extension.</li>
	<li>The Client Identification (ClientID) of the Catalog.</li>
</ul>
<p>The method checks that the input ClientID is the one used to create the catalog 
or to upgrade it. If the test fails, you are not considered as an owner of the catalog.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="Keychain principle"></a>Keychain Principle</h3>
<p>A credentials object is like a keychain. It means that it can contain several 
credentials.</p>
<pre class="code">CATFmCredentials MyCredentials;
MyCredentials.RegisterAsApplicationBasedOn (CATFmFeatureModelerID,MyPartnerId)
MyCredentials.RegisterAsCatalogOwner(&quot;CtlgDefiningA_Name&quot;, CtlgDefiningA_ClientID);
MyCredentials.RegisterAsCatalogOwner (&quot;CtlgDefiningB_Name&quot;, CtlgDefiningB_ClientID);
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>A call to <code>RegisterAsApplicationBasedOn </code>must be done in first.</li>
	<li>You could have several calls to <code>RegisterAsApplicationBasedOn
	</code>when DS will provide several Infrastructure id. But the PartnerId will 
	be the same for each call.</li>
	<li>You can already have several calls to <code>RegisterAsCatalogOwner</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a credential could be used through your application to create a container, 
to handle your features defined by the catalog A and the Catalog B, and to instantiate 
them within an applicative container. </p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="Facade and Credential"></a>Facade and Credentials</h3>
<p>Façade can be created with or without a credentials object. Indeed, a credentials 
can be useless sometimes:</p>
<pre class="code">CATFmFeatureFacade MyResultFacadeWithoutCredentials;
CATIxxx *pIxxx = NULL ; 
Rc = MyResultFacadeWithoutCredentials.QueryInterfaceOnFeature(IID_CATIxxx, (void **) &amp; pIxxx);
</pre>
<p>If you have interfaces to handle the underlying object of the facade (container 
&amp; feature), thanks the <code>QueryInterfaceOnFeature </code>method of these two 
kind of facades, you can get a CATIxxx interface pointer on the underlying feature, 
and below the control of this interface you can work with it.</p>
<p>But once the facade&#8217;s creation is passed, the credentials for the facade cannot 
be changed, except by = operator, which changes the underlying object and the credential 
object.</p>
<pre class="code">CATFmCredentials MyCredential;
CATFmFeatureFacade TheFacadeOnMyObject(MyCredential);

CATFmFeatureFacade MyFacadeOnOuputObject;
TheFacadeOnMyObject.xxx (MyFacadeOnOuputObject);</pre>
<p>In this piece of code we call the method xxx on the facade <code>TheFacadeOnMyObject</code>. 
You have yourself created the facade to be returned by the method (<code>MyFacadeOnOuputObject</code>), 
the xxx method will not change the credentials. The xxx method will only bind a 
new object (here a feature) to the returned facade.</p>
<p>For the = operator, the bound object and the credential are changed.</p>
<pre class="code">...
CATFmFeatureFacade TheFeatFacade1(MyCredential1,pFeat1);

CATFmFeatureFacade TheFeatFacade2(MyCredential2);
TheFeatFacade2 = TheFeatFacade1;</pre>
<p><code>TheFeatFacade2</code> is now bound to <code>pFeat1</code> and with
<code>MyCredential1</code> credentials.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h2><a name="Credential in detail"></a>Credentials in detail</h2>
<h3><a name="Credentials for feat facade"></a>Credentials for Feature Facade</h3>
<p>As we mentioned before, we work with features using feature facade, an entity 
bound to an underlying feature and associated with Credentials granting client authorization 
to handle the underlying feature. In other words, we may work with a feature either 
as its owner or in a different role, determined by the associated credentials. Thus 
based on your role, client may either be prohibited or may have complete or limited 
access to an underlying feature or to the features linked to it (pointing, pointed, 
aggregated, parent, extensions). </p>
<p>Lets us present some scenarios with the aid of a feature data model depicted 
in [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>] below.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.1"></a>Fig. 1 Feature Data Model</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Feature Data Model" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig1.gif" width="380" height="269"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>At the centre of the data model is &quot;Feature A&quot;, which</p>
<ul>
	<li>is aggregated under FeatureAE (refered as the parent)</li>
	<li>has an attribute x, an integer type</li>
	<li>has an attribute y, of type &quot;specObject&quot; pointing to FeatureB</li>
	<li>has an attribute z, of type &quot;component&quot; valuated to FeatureC (aggregated 
	feature)</li>
	<li>Extends two features (FeatureExt1 and FeatureExt2)</li>
	<li>is pointed by a feature, FeatureDAsInst (an instance of FeatureDAsRef) (Please 
	note FeatureD is an instance of another Feature Instance, which serves as its 
	Reference)</li>
</ul>
<p>The features depicted in the data model above, are defined in the catalogs listed 
below</p>
<ul>
	<li>FeatureA / FeatureAE are defined by the feature catalog A</li>
	<li>FeatureB is defined by the feature catalog B</li>
	<li>FeatureC is defined by the feature catalog C</li>
	<li>FeatureDAsRef is defined by the feature catalog D</li>
	<li>FeatureExt1 is defined by the feature catalog Ext1</li>
	<li>FeatureExt2 is defined by the feature catalog Ext2</li>
</ul>
<p>We next present the scenarios. We have adapted the following color convention 
in the figures that are depicted in each scenario:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Red: no access to the feature </li>
	<li>Orange: access to the feature, but limited access through a facade</li>
	<li>Green : access to the feature, and a full access through a facade</li>
</ul>
<p>The following scenarios are</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#cas 1">Working with Feature A, as its Owner (meaning as the owner 
	of the Catalog A)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#cas2">Working with Feature A, as Owner of Catalog D</a></li>
	<li><a href="#cas 3">Working with Feature A, as Owner of Catalog Ext1</a></li>
	<li><a href="#cas 4">Working with FeatureExt1, as Owner of Catalog Ext1</a></li>
	<li><a href="#cas 5">Inherited Attribute Access</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="cas 1"></a>Let&#8217;s consider the first case where we work with FeatureA, 
as its owner (meaning as the owner of the CatalogA, which defines it)</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.2"></a>Fig. 2 Working with Feature A, as its Owner</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Working with Feature A, as its Owner" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig2.gif" width="386" height="241"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>From feature A, you have a full access to its contents, it means:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You have a full access to its attributes, primitive ones like X, and the 
	link&#8217;s attributes : those representing a pointed feature (like Feature B) or 
	an aggregated one (like Feature C) </li>
	<li>You have a full access to its features extension ( Feature Ext1 &amp; Feature 
	Ext2)</li>
	<li>You can remove any feature extensions (for addition see <a href="#cas 3">
	Working with Feature A, as Owner of Catalog Ext1</a>)</li>
	<li>You have access to internal data about its typing (type, startup), its naming 
	(display name) and other internal information (container, reference (if exists) 
	, parent (if exists-here Feature AE) </li>
	<li>You can get all features pointing to it (FeatureDAsinst)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the retrieved features (parent, pointed, pointing, aggregated, extension), 
if you use the same credential (as owner of catalog A), here except the parent (FeatureAE 
is also defined by catalog A), you are not granted to access them since they are 
not defined by catalog A. It means that even if you can got them, once you have 
a facade on the retrieved feature, to be owner of catalog A will be not enough. 
For example, from FeatureDAsinst you could not get its Reference (FeatureDAref), 
or from FeatureExt1 you could not use a method to access its attribute. </p>
<p><a name="cas2"></a>Now we proceed to work with FeatureA, but as an owner of Catalog 
D.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.3"></a>Fig. 3 Working with Feature A, as Owner of Catalog 
	D</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Working with Feature A, as Owner of Catalog D" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig3.gif" width="355" height="248"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>From Feature A you retrieve all instances of StartUp FeatureD pointing to 
	it. The facade bound to feature A is not completely useless since you can get 
	some information like those pointing to it. But you cannot retrieve attributes 
	from Feature A neither extensions to it</li>
	<li>The Feature D is green because we assume we use the same credential (owner 
	of catalog D) to retrieve it. So, you can get its reference feature, and since 
	reference and instance come from the same StartUp, you can work with the Reference 
	feature, as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="cas 3"></a>Now let us proceed to work with FeatureA, but as an owner 
of the catalog Ext1.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.4"></a>Fig.4 Working with Feature A, as Owner of Catalog 
	Ext1</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Working with Feature A, as Owner of Catalog Ext1" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig4.gif" width="341" height="246"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>From Feature A you can only retrieve its extension of type Ext1. FeatureExt1 
	is shown green because we assume that we use the same credential (owner of catalog 
	Ext1) to handle it. </li>
	<li>From Feature A, you could not retrieve FeatureExt2 since you are not owner 
	of the catalog Ext2</li>
	<li>From Feature A, being only owner of catalog Ext1, enable you to add it an 
	extension of type Ext1 (if it does not already exist). It is normal, since usually 
	you add extension on base feature owning to DS or third party, so for which 
	you are not the catalog&#39;s owner.</li>
	<li>From Feature A, being only owner of catalog Ext1 is enough to be able to 
	remove it an extension of type Ext1 (being owner of the base feature catalog 
	enables the operation too <a href="#cas 1">#</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="cas 4"></a>Now, we are still the owner of the catalog Ext1, but imagine 
that we create a facade bound to the feature extension Ext1.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.5"></a>Fig.5 Working with FeatureExt1, as Owner of Catalog 
	Ext1</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Working with FeatureExt1, as Owner of Catalog Ext1" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig5.gif" width="341" height="246"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>From Feature Ext1, you have as full access to its contents [<a href="#Fig.5">Fig.5</a>], 
and specially its base feature, FeatureA. But FeatureA, with a credential as owner 
of Catalog Ext1, you cannot fully use it.</p>
<p><a name="cas 5"></a>The last example will be about the inherited attributes. 
Suppose that the StartUp defining the Feature B derives from a StartUp defined in 
a catalog other than Catalog B (Catalog K, for example)</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.6"></a>Fig.6 Inherited Attribute Access</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Inherited Attribute Access" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig6.gif" width="206" height="266"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Here StartUp B, defined within feature catalog B, is deriving from the StartUp 
K defined in the feature catalog K.</p>
<p>When you have instances of StartUp B, the feature instances contain attributes 
from StartUp B (X, Y) and from Startup K (Name), the inherited StartUp. But according 
to your credentials you could access all or only a part of the attributes from an 
instance of Feature B. </p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.7"></a>Fig.7 Partial Access for Partial Credentials</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Partial Access for Partial Credentials" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig7.gif" width="390" height="125"></td>

</table>
<ul>
	<li>On left, you are the owner of both catalog, B and K, you have an access 
	to all attributes</li>
	<li>On middle, you are only owner of catalog B, you could access ( read / write) 
	only the attributes defined by StartUp B (X, Y)</li>
	<li>On right, you are only owner of catalog K, you could access ( read / write) 
	only the attributes defined by StartUp K (Name)</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude, we have split in four categories the methods of the CATFmFeatureFacade 
class :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Methods to manage the facade<p>The methods to retrieve the binding feature, 
	or to change it, are without credential checks</p>
	</li>
	<li>Methods to access attributes and internal stuff, and for instantiation purpose<p>
	These methods are successful only if the facade contains the credential as owner 
	of the catalog defining the underlying feature [<a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>]. 
	So, it means that if you are not the owner of the catalog defining the StartUp 
	derived to create your own StartUp, you will never access the attributes coming 
	from this StartUp. [<a href="#Fig.7">Fig.7</a>, case 3]</p>
	</li>
	<li>Methods to retrieve a list of features<p>These methods return a list through 
	an iterator and never fail, even if the facade is without credentials. In the 
	later case, the iterator will be just without element. If you are the owner 
	of the underlying feature you will retrieve all features (pointing and extension), 
	otherwise you will retrieve only those for which you are granted authorization. 
	About the method returning one extension (by its name) the behavior is exactly 
	the same as remove one extension. See the point that follows</p>
	</li>
	<li>Methods to add and remove feature extensions<p>Adding an extension requires 
	that you are owner of the extension. That you are owner or not of the underlying 
	feature (the base feature) it does not matter. Removing an extension is less 
	restrictive. If you are the owner of a base feature you can remove or retrieve 
	any kind of extension, while if you are the owner of an extension, you can delete 
	them from any base feature. </p>
	</li>
</ul>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="Credential for container facade"></a>Credentials for Container Facade</h3>
<p>There are fewer operations for a container than for a feature. You can only realize 
an instantiation inside a container, and scan its contents. Like for a feature, 
to handle a container you must first create a facade container. You create a container 
facade with a credential object, and you bind it with a container.</p>
<p>For an instantiation</p>
<ul>
	<li>The facade for the container must contain the credentials as a client application 
	to the Infrastructure which owns the Container, which will grant the instantiation.</li>
	<li>The facade for the feature (or the StartUp) to instantiate must contain 
	the credentials as an owner of the Catalog, which defines the feature to instantiate.</li>
</ul>
<p>For scanning, the container facade must at least contain the credential as a 
client application to the Infrastructure which owns the Container, which will grant 
the scanning. But it is not enough. To retrieve feature, you must also have the 
credentials as an owner of the Catalog, which defines the feature to be retrieved.</p>
<p>Have a look at this container</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.8"></a>Fig. 8 A sample Container</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="A sample Container" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig8.gif" width="413" height="114"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>If you are the owner of the catalog A and D and based on the Feature modeler 
infrastructure, the result of the scan are the green features as depicted below.</p>
<table>
	<caption><a name="Fig.9"></a>Fig. 9 Results of the First Scan</caption>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="Results of the First Scan" src="images/CAAFmExtTAUnderstandingCredentials_Fig9.gif" width="413" height="114"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>You only get the Startup A and D instances. </p>
<p>The methods to retrieve the underlying container are free, meaning are without 
credential checks.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h3><a name="Credentials for StartUp"></a>Credentials For StartUp</h3>
<p>The last feature entity managed through a facade (credentials) is a StartUp. 
We instantiate a StartUp, through its facade. The credentials associated with the 
StartUp facade should be that of the owner of the Catalog defining the StartUp.</p>
<p>Contrary to a feature or a container facade, one does not require access to the 
underlying entity of a StartUp facade, since we never have to directly work with 
it. Its quite risky, as well. Infact, the StartUp facade is instantiated with the 
StartUp name as its input, unlike the other facades, which have feature as the key 
input.</p>
<p>The methods <code>GetTypeName</code>() and <code>BuildFrom</code>() of the StartUp 
facade retrieves the StartUp information.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">insertLinkToTop();</script>
<h2><a name="Example"></a>Example</h2>
<p>Before leaving the technical article, let us present a basic scenario. Then you 
may pursue with use cases. The scenario is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Instantiating a Startup A inside a container</li>
	<li>Valuating an attribute of the new instance</li>
	<li>Scanning the container to retrieve all instances of type A (Features A)</li>
	<li>Retrieving the Ext1 extension on the retrieved Features A</li>
</ul>
<p>We create the Credentials object</p>

<p>We have a credentials object defining my identity as owner of the catalog defining 
the StartUp A and working as based on the Feature Modeler infrastructure. Note that 
we are not declared as owner of the catalog defining the Extension Ext1.</p>
<p>We create the facades for the Startup to Instantiate, and for the container where 
the Instantiation will occur.</p>

CATBaseUnknown * pContainer = &#8230; ;
CATFmContainerFacade MyContainerFacade (MyCredentials,pContainer);

<p>We perform the instantiation.</p>
<pre class="code">...		
CATFmFeatureFacade  NewInstance (MyCredentials);
MyStartUpFacade.InstantiateIn(MyContainerFacade, NewInstance );
...</pre>
<p>The <code>InstantiateIn </code>method binds the <code>NewInstance </code>facade 
with the new feature. If you don&#8217;t initialize <code>NewInstance </code>with a credential,
<code>InstantiateIn </code>will not fail, but you could not use the new facade to 
manage the feature&#8217;s attributes.</p>
<p>Set a new value for one attribute of the new feature.</p>
<pre class="code">...		
CATFmAttributeName XattributeName (&#8220;X&#8221;);
CATFmAttributeValue XattributeValue (3);
NewInstance.SetValue(XattributeName, XattributeValue) ;
...
</pre>
<p>This method <code>SetValue </code>does not fail because NewInstance is granted 
as owner of the catalog defining the StartUp A. </p>
<p>Next we scan the container to retrieve all instances of type A.</p>
<pre class="code">...		
CATFmFeatureIterator MyIteratorForFeatureA;
MyContainerFacade.ScanFeatures(MyIteratorForFeatureA) ;
...
</pre>
<p>The <code>ScanFeatures </code>method retrieves all features A (instances of the 
StartUp A) inside the container. The credentials of <code>MyContainerFacade
</code>only contains the right to handle StartUp A features.</p>
<p>Retrieving the Ext1 extension from each retrieved Features A.</p>
<pre class="code">...		
CATFmFeatureFacade MyFacadeForCurrent(MyCredentials);
Rc = MyIteratorForFeatureA.Next(MyFacadeForCurrent) ;
while (SUCCEEDED(rc)) 
{
     CATFmFeatureFacade MyExtensionAsFeatureFacade ;
     MyFacadeForCurrent.GetExtension (&#8220;Ext1&#8221;,MyExtensionAsFeatureFacade);
     
     CATIMyInterfaceOnEx1t *pIntExt = NULL ;
     MyExtensionAsFeatureFacade.QueryInterfaceOnFeature(IID_CATIMyInterfaceOnExt1,
                                                       (void **)&amp; pIntExt);
     ...
     rc = MyIteratorForFeatureA.Next(MyFacadeForCurrent) ;
}
...
</pre>
<p><code>MyIteratorForFeatures </code>contains all the instance of the StartUp A 
inside the container. Each facade that you get with the Next method (<code>MyFacadeForCurrent</code>) 
is an instance of StartUp A.</p>
<p>Since the credential of <code>MyFacadeForCurrent</code> contains the privilige 
to handle the StartUp A feature, you can get all its extensions for which the name 
is &#8220;Ext1&#8221;. So the <code>GetExtension </code>method is successful. </p>
<p>But to handle the retrieved extension, <code>MyExtensionAsFeatureFacade</code>, 
since you are not the owner of the catalog defining the feature extension Ext1, 
the only thing that you can do, is to get the extension feature as a pointer and 
to use an interface implemented by Ext1 feature.</p>

<h2><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h2>
<p>We must have a controlled access to a feature data model, be it DS or User defined, 
since IP protection is fundamental. This is accomplished by introducing a facade 
class, a feature modeler entity which serves as a wrapper over an underlying entity 
(feature, container), associated with the required Credentials.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, we have two types of credentials</p>
<ul>
	<li>Catalog credentials, which define you as an owner of a catalog, thus granting 
	your authorization to handle the features defined in this catalog. It implies 
	that the features could be instantiated and retrieved by scanning a container</li>
	<li>Container credentials, which define you based on an Infrastructure managing 
	Container&#39;s access right, thus granting your authorization to instantiate features 
	inside a container and scan it subsequently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The credentials object is represented by the <em>CATFmCredentials</em> class. 
This class exposes the <code>RegisterAsCatalogOwner</code> and the <code>RegisterAsApplicationBasedOn</code> 
methods which appends the Catalog and the Container credentials respectively to 
the Credentials object. </p>
<p>A client could work with a feature as its owner or in a different role, determined 
by the credentials. As an owner one has complete access to the feature attributes 
(primitive and link types), thus letting one retrieve the linked features (aggregated, 
pointed, pointing, extension, reference, parent). The linked features though cannot 
be introspected, unless you have the credentials for those, as well.</p>
