		<p class="header">This guide deals with customizing data models and behaviors 
		of PLM objects.</p>
		<p><b>Warning</b>: Except for &quot;Pre-customized&quot; modelers, any customization 
		is for demonstration purposes, and must not be used for production deployment</p>
		<p>As such, most of VPM Customization samples illustrating this guide, as 
		delivered through the VPM Environment, are not relevant to be put in customer 
		production. It may be used for demonstration purpose only, and may change 
		over the time to better illustrate customization capabilities.</p>
		<p>OOTB Team Customization, as delivered through the PLM_Team Environment, 
		is relevant to be put as-is in customer production. This OOTB Team Customization 
		is not mentioned in this guide and is not a customization starter. It may 
		be used for production, given the fact it is not modified by the customer. 
		OOTB Customization may evolve over the time to better match customer and 
		end user expectations.</p>
		<p>Administrators need to choose the OOTB Team Customization for production, 
		or engineers implement and deploy their own customizations for production. 
		Several customization techniques need to be put in action in order to achieve 
		a customization, starting from the data model customization on server up 
		to Business Logic integration on Rich client. The purpose of this guide 
		is to focus on Customizing the VPM Modelers.</p>
