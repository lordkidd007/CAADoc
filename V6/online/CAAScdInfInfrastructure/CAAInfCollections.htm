<p>A collection is an object that gathers objects of
the same type and is denoted as a plural name. For example, the <strong>Editors</strong> 
object is a collection of <strong>Editor</strong>
objects and provides methods for managing individual editors in the collection.</p>
<p>A member of the collection is retrieved using the <strong>Item</strong> method and the
index of the member in the collection. Usually, the argument representing the
index in the <strong>Item</strong> method is a Variant. This means that it can either
represent the rank of the member in the collection or the name you assigned to
this member using the <strong>Name</strong> property. The rank in a collection begins at 1.
For example, assume that the window named <strong>CATIA</strong> is the sixth
window in the <strong>Windows</strong> collection. To retrieve this window in the <strong>Win</strong>
variable, write:</p>
<pre class="code"><span class="keyword">Dim</span> Win <span class="keyword">As</span> Window
<span class="keyword">Set</span> Win = CATIA.Windows.Item(6)</pre>
<p>or write:</p>
<pre class="code"><span class="keyword">Dim</span> Win <span class="keyword">As</span> Window
<span class="keyword">Set</span> Win = CATIA.Windows.Item(&quot;CATIA&quot;)</pre>
<p>Each collection has a <strong>Count</strong> property that holds the number of members in
the collection. This is a handy property to scan the whole collection. For
example, to print the name of each window of the collection of windows in a message box,
write:</p>
<pre class="code"><span class="keyword">For</span> I = 1 <span class="keyword">To</span> CATIA.Windows.Count
  msgbox CATIA.Windows.Item(I).Name
<span class="keyword">Next</span></pre>
<p>or write:</p>
<pre class="code">I = 0
<span class="keyword">Do</span>
  I = I + 1
  msgbox CATIA.Windows.Item(I).Name
<span class="keyword">Until</span> I = CATIA.Windows.Count</pre>
<p>You can also use the <strong>For Each</strong> instruction to scan the collection, and
get rid of the counter:</p>
<pre class="code"><span class="keyword">For Each</span> Win <span class="keyword">In</span> CATIA.Windows
  msgbox Win.Name
<span class="keyword">Next</span></pre>
<p>In this case, the <strong>Win</strong> variable is reinitialized using the current
window, starting with the first one and ending with the last one.</p>
<p>A collection may have a <strong>Add</strong> method to enable you to create a new member in the collection. 
Otherwise, a method is provided in another object to enable you to create new 
objects and make them members of the collection. For example, the <strong>Window</strong> 
object has a <strong>NewWindow</strong> method that duplicates the window from which the 
method is called and adds it to the collection of windows. In the same way, a 
collection may have a <strong>Remove</strong> method to enable you delete a member of the 
collection. This does not apply to objects that do require a consistent system 
management, such as editors, or that are managed by other software, such as 
printers.</p>
